The Life of St Pankratios of Taormina describes the mission and
martyrdom of St Pankratios, a disciple of the Apostle Peter sent to
evangelize Taormina as its first bishop and purports to have been
written by St Pankratios' successor, Euagrios.  The text was composed in
the early eighth century and is of Sicilian provenance.

The
Life contributes to our understanding of the Byzantine attitude to the
past and of the novelistic approach to hagiography.  It touches on the
topography of Sicily and Calabria, ecclesiastical arrangements in
Sicily, civil and military administration, the Sicilian language
question, church decoration, liturgical rites, book production and the
attitude to religious images.
