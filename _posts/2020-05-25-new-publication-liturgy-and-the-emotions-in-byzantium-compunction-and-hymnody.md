This
book explores the liturgical experience of emotions in Byzantium through
the hymns of Romanos the Melodist, Andrew of Crete and Kassia. It
reimagines the performance of their hymns during Great Lent and Holy
Week in Constantinople.  In doing so, it understands compunction as a
liturgical emotion, intertwined with paradisal nostalgia, a desire for
repentance and a wellspring of tears.  For the faithful, liturgical
emotions were embodied experiences that were enacted through sacred song
and mystagogy.  The three hymnographers chosen for this study span a
period of nearly four centuries and had an important connection to
Constantinople, which forms the topographical and liturgical nexus of
the study.  Their work also covers three distinct genres of hymnography:
kontakion, kanon and sticheron idiomelon.  Through these lenses of
period, place and genre this study examines the affective performativity
hymns and the Byzantine experience of compunction.
