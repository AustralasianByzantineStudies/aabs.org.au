25-27 March 2017**

For its
50th anniversary, the Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies returns to
the University of Birmingham, where it began in 1967. On this
anniversary of the discipline we ask what the language of globalism has
to offer to Byzantine studies, and Byzantine studies to global
narratives. How global was Byzantium? Our understanding of the links
which Byzantium had to far-flung parts of the world, and of its
connections with near neighbours, continues to develop but the
significance of these connections to Byzantium and its interlocutors
remains keenly debated. Comparisons from or to Byzantium may also help
in thinking about globalism, modern and historical. How, for example,
might Byzantine legal structures, visual culture or military practice
contribute to debates about the role of the medieval state or the
relationship between modern cultural and national identities? Finally,
Byzantine studies has always been an international discipline, marked by
the interaction of its different national, regional and linguistic
traditions of scholarship, as well as its highly interdisciplinary
nature. How has this manifested in the interpretation of Byzantine
history and how might practices of global scholarship be pursued in the
future? The 50th Spring Symposium invites contributions for
communications on any of these themes and warmly invites abstracts from
scholars outside the UK and in fields linked to Byzantine
studies.

The call for communications is now open. If you
would like to offer a 10-minute communication on the theme of the
symposium, please send an abstract of no more than 250 words to Daniel
Reynolds
[atd.k.reynolds@bham.ac.uk](mailto:atd.k.reynolds@bham.ac.uk)
by **1 September, 2016**.

Successful submissions will be
informed no later than 1 October 2016. Some bursaries will be available
to selected speakers, especially to attendees from outside the UK. If
you would like to be considered for a bursary please indicate this on
your abstract and we will send you further information about the
application process if appropriate.
