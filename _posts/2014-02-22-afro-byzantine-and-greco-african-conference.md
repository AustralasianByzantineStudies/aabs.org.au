title: Afro-Byzantine and Greco-African Conference
date: 2014-02-22

We invite you to participate in the International Conference on
Greco-African and Afro-Byzantine Studies at the University of
Johannesburg to be held **27 October--1 November 2014**.

An
International Conference on Greco-African and Afro-Byzantine Studies
(i.e. History, Civilization, Culture, Arts) will take place in
October/November 2014 at UJ. With Afro-Byzantine Studies we understand
the study of the African civilizations of which the development was
influenced by Byzantine history and civilization (mainly late ancient
and medieval North Africa, Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia). Greco-African
Studies refer to the study and teaching of Greek in Africa, cultural
interaction between (Ancient and Modern) Greece and Africa. By extension
Ancient/Medieval Africa itself can be combined with these themes. The
conference will thus be a vehicle giving the occasion to its
participants to relate and work together in order to further determine,
assess, appreciate and promote high quality research on selected aspects
of 'Old' African history and civilization in conjunction with Greece,
mainly Byzantium.

The proposed Conference will greatly
contribute to a better assessment, comprehension and appreciation of the
great African Civilization of the past. Consequently, it will present an
occasion to exchange views on our knowledge of its ideological,
political, institutional, artistic and religious
aspects.

Peer-reviewed Proceedings will be published. We are
already negotiating with publishers.

A communication may be
either 30 minutes or 15 minutes. There will be seminars and discussion
groups. Please, let us know in which category or categories you will
participate. We ask to send us the theme of your presentation before **1
July**, and at least by **1 October** a short abstract of your paper (10
to 15 lines). Your paper can be given to the organisers during or at the
end of the Conference for publication and
peer-reviewing.
