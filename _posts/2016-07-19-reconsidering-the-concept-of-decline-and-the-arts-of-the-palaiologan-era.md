One day and a half Symposium & Workshop, University of
Birmingham**, 24-25 February 2017**

This one day and a half
conference combines a symposium and a workshop. The aim is to examine
and contextualise the artistic and cultural production of the
geopolitical centres that were controlled by or in contact with the late
Byzantine Empire, such as the Adriatic and Balkan regions, the major
islands of Cyprus and Crete, and the regions surrounding the cities of
Constantinople, Thessaloniki, and Mystras. This conference will explore
the many intellectual implications that are encoded in the innovative
artistic production of the Palaiologan Era often simplified by a rigid
understanding of what is Byzantine and what is not.

In its
last centuries, the political entity of the Empire of the Romaioi
released cultural and artistic energies migrating towards new frontiers
of intellectual achievements. The intent is to counter-balance the
innovation of these works of art with the notion of decline and the
narrative of decay frequently acknowledged for this period; and to
promote an understanding of transformation where previous cultural
heritages were integrated into new socio-political
orders.

**The Symposium** -- hosted on the afternoon of the
24 and the morning of the 25 February -- will bring together established
scholars, early-career scholars, and postgraduate students. Three
keynotes will provide the methodological framework for the discussion;
while the selected papers will focus solely on the visual expressions
and cultural trajectories of the artworks produced during the late
Palaiologan Era.
**
The Workshop**, hosted on the afternoon of
the 25 February, will offer the opportunity to further the discussion in
a more informal setting and for a selected number of Master students to
interact and offer brief presentations.

Postgraduate students
and early-career scholars are invited to submit proposals for
twenty-minute papers on art and architecture history, material culture,
visual aspects of palaeography and codicology, and gender
studies.

Topics may include but are not limited to:


-   Gift exchange in view of diplomatic missions or dynastic marriages
    both within the Empire and with its neighbours
-   Visual evidence of the interaction between the Emperor and the
    Patriarch
-   Innovations in the visual agenda of the Palaiologan dynasty
-   Aspects of religious iconography and visual representations of
    theological controversies, i.e. Hesychasm
-   Artistic patronage and manuscript production as the outcome of
    dynastic and institutional interactions
-   Visual and material production as the outcome of political and
    social circumstances, i.e. the Zealot uprising or the Unionist
    policy
-   Evidence of artistic exchanges in the depictions of women, men, and
    children during the Palaiologan Era


Titles of proposed papers, abstracts of 250 words, and a short CV
should be sent to Maria Alessia Rossi (The Courtauld Institute of Art)
