The Arts and Religions in Antiquity program unit of the Society of
Biblical Literature is sponsoring three sessions at the 2014 annual
meeting in San Diego, **22-25 November 2014**.

We welcome
proposals on the art and material culture of any ancient religious
tradition and encourage papers that address the use of art and material
culture in service of religion. For the two open sessions, the Art and
Religions of Antiquity section especially seeks paper proposals that
address the following topics - but all proposals will be considered: 1)
Art and Ritual: For this session we seek papers that address the role of
art and material culture as it relates to ritual practice. Papers that
treat the ritual handling of art; art in ritual spaces; rituals depicted
in art; ritual as art are most welcome. 2) Art and Death: For this
session, we seek papers that address the role of art and material
culture as it relates to death. Papers that treat memorial practice or
art in funerary contexts will be most welcome. We will also sponsor a
third session that will consist of invited papers to review the recent
book by J. Patout Burns and Robin M. Jensen, Christianity in Roman
Africa (Eerdmans, 2014).

Call for papers closes **5 March
2014**.
