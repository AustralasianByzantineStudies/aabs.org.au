20^th^ annual UNISA Classics Colloquium

We are pleased to
announce the first call for papers for the annual *UNISA Classics
Colloquium*, to be held in Pretoria from **15 to 18 August
2019**.

The conference aims to explore issues marking
celebrations, commemorations and anniversaries of all kinds around the
ancient world (up to the 7th century CE, but including its reception in
later periods).  Topics enlarging on the literary, social and political
significance of such events in the building of not only civic identities
but also individual legacies, as well as the appropriation of these
occasions in later contexts, will be welcomed.

Paper
proposals (approximately 300 words) are invited for papers of 30 minutes
debating current issues and problems on any aspect of the above theme. 
Abstracts and titles should include your name and university
affiliation, and should be submitted to either:


-   Liana Lamprecht at <lamprjc@unisa.ac.za>
-   Martine De Marre at <dmarrmea@gmail.com>


Deadline for abstracts: **30 April 2019**

Details of
the conference venue, accommodation and other important information will
be made available on the conference web site, which we hope to have up
and running soon.

We look forward to hearing from you, and
please do not hesitate to contact us at the addresses provided above if
you have any queries.
