Call for Papers**
**


Proposals for papers are sought for a hybrid conference
(participation possible both in person and online) on **16-17 June
2022** exploring the writing of historiography in context of the
developments in biographical literature during late
antiquity.

The relationship between historiography and
biography in antiquity has always been an uneasy one. Despite their
mutual interest in strong characters, the writing of history and the
writing of lives were regarded by ancient authors as two distinct
genres. This separation proved influential too among modern scholars,
but there have long existed voices suggesting that the boundaries
between the two were much more blurred in practice (Momigliano 1971;
Geiger 1985; Kraus 2010). Such considerations are particularly important
for the later period because of the dynamic literary transformations it
catalysed. The changing literary landscape from the fourth century on,
in East and West, was shaped not only by the rise of new genres but also
by the shift, redefinition, and even breakdown of established generic
boundaries (Greatrex/Elton 2015).

Recent scholarship has
shown the fruitful interrelationships with contemporary literature of
both later historiography (Blaudeau/van Nuffelen 2015; van Nuffelen
2019; Conterno/Mazzola 2020) and biography (Urbano 2013, HÃ¤gg/Rousseau
2000). But the link between the two remains largely unexplored. With the
emergence of new biographical sub-genres -- like hagiography or
heresiology -- and the blossoming of old ones -- such as panegyric or
philosophical biography -- historians could draw on a hitherto unmatched
spectrum of different models when incorporating the lives and deeds of
individual characters into their historical narratives. This conference
aims to investigate how historians adjusted to this increasing diversity
of life-writing and what impact this development had on the evolution of
historiography.

We invite scholars of varied specialisms and
disciplinary backgrounds interested in the history and literature of the
late antique world to submit 500-word abstracts for 30-minute papers.
Papers might treat, for example:


-   the factors that influenced historians' choice of a particular model
    of biographical presentation over another;
-   the incorporation and adaptation of biographical source material
    (including translations) into historiography;
-   how historians played with their readers' expectations by both
    alluding to and breaking the generic conventions of different types
    of biographical literature;
-   the differences in the presentation of lives across the
    historiographical traditions of alternative writing cultures, like
    Syriac or Coptic;
-   how imagined audiences determined the stylistic and compositional
    choices of historians narrating the life of a historical character.


We are happy to announce Peter van Nuffelen (Ghent University) and
Anne Alwis (University of Kent) as confirmed keynote speakers of the
conference.

Applications from all scholars, including
postgraduate students, are welcome. Abstracts of 500 words should be
sent to

5:00 pm on **14 January 2022**.
