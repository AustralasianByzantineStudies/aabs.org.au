Fourth International Conference "Roman and Late Antique Thrace"
(RaLATh), **12--16 October 2020**, Burgas,
Bulgaria

Strategically located and rather vulnerable at the
same time, ancient Thrace experienced a fairly large number of turbulent
episodes throughout its existence. Several unsettling events, ranging
from man-made conflicts to natural disasters, have disrupted the usual
rhythm of civic life and have left their imprint on historical record.
The Fourth RaLATh Conference seeks to explore these processes by
inviting scholars from various academic backgrounds. Relevant
contributions will focus on different aspects of conflicts and
catastrophes in Thrace: emergence, duration, chronology, management, and
mitigation of the aftermath. Topics of interest include but are not
limited to:


-   armed conflicts -- invasions, battles, uprisings
-   diplomatic rifts and discords
-   economic crises
-   natural disasters -- earthquakes, floods, fires etc.
-   epidemics


Papers should not exceed 20 minutes. Posters should be of A1 size
(594 x 841 mm). Authors should be aware of copyright regulations and
will be responsible for bringing and presenting their printed posters.
Conference languages: English, German, French. Paper proposals of up to
300 words and poster proposals of up to 200 words should be sent to
