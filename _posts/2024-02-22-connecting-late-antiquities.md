On behalf of Professors Julia Hillner (BCDSS) and Richard Flower
(University of Exeter), we cordially invite colleagues to submit paper
proposals for our conference on *Connecting Late Antiquities*, to be
held at the University of Bonn, **3-5 February
2025**.

*Connecting Late Antiquities*, generously sponsored
by Germany's Deutsche Forschungs-gemeinschaft and the UK's Arts and
Humanities Research Council, is a collaborative project to create open,
digital prosopographical resources for the Roman and post-Imperial
territories between the third and seventh centuries. Its main aim is to
digitise, unite, and link existing resources to make them more
accessible and enhance their reach and utility. The enterprise will
dramatically improve access to information about late-antique people for
all scholars of this period and allow the easy integration of
prosopographical material with online geographical, textual, epigraphic,
and papyrological resources.

Technological developments have
provided new opportunities for prosopography, including allowing for
both constant updating and an expansion beyond the traditional focus on
the higher echelons of society. *The Prosopography of the Byzantine
Empire* and *Prosopography of the Byzantine World* projects provide
excellent examples of the greater possibilities allowed by this
approach. *Connecting Late Antiquities* will draw together material from
a variety of major printed prosopographies and specialist digital
databases, as well as incorporating entries for 'non-elite'
individuals who are attested in ancient sources but have not been
included in earlier publications. This approach will allow more
extensive research into understudied figures and their social
connections.

We have a limited number of slots for papers of
up to 20 minutes in length and therefore invite colleagues to submit
abstracts of max. 300 words (plus a brief bio) on any aspect of Late
Antique prosopography.

We particularly welcome submissions
suggesting new discoveries and approaches within the following
themes:


-   Prosopography and the rise of literature in Late Antique local
    languages, both western (e.g. Irish, Pictish, Welsh) and eastern
    (e.g. Armenian, Coptic, Syriac).
-   Prosopography and the 'usual suspects' (aristocracies, rulers,
    office-holders, etc.).
-   Prosopography and the 'unusual suspects' (e.g. anonymous
    individuals, marginalised individuals, religious minorities,
    non-privileged groups).
-   Prosopography and gender.
-   Prosopography and the challenges, limits, and opportunities of
    digital humanities.
-   Methodological avenues to overcome traditional prosopographical
    segregations (e.g. clerical/secular, elite/lower-status,
    human/non-human).


Confirmed roundtable participants and speakers include Yanne
Broux,  Niels Gaul, Rodrigo Laham Cohen, Hartmut Leppin, Ralph Mathisen,
Muriel Moser, Silvia Orlandi, Arietta Papaconstantinou, Claire Sotinel,
Scott Vanderbilt, and Lieve Van Hoof.

We are hoping to cover
three nights of accommodation in Bonn, travel expenses, plus all lunches
and one conference dinner.

Please send your abstract plus bio
to Jeroen Wijnendaele ( <jwijnend@uni-bonn.de> ) and Jessica van 't
Westeinde ( [jwestend@uni-bonn.de](mailto:jvantwes@uni-bonn.de) ) no
later than **1 May 2024.**
