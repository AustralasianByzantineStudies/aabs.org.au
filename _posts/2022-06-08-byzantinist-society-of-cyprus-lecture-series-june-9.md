The Byzantinist Society of Cyprus is organizing an online lecture series
under the general title "Mediterranean Crossroads". During the first
cycle of the series (Spring-Summer 2022), Professors Judith Herrin,
Alessandro Taddei and Athanasios Markopoulos will offer presentations
shedding light on different aspects of Byzantine history and
culture.

The lecture series aims at the promotion of
Byzantine and Medieval Studies through the research perspectives of
leading international scholars. Cyprus and the Mediterranean have been
at the crossroads of history and culture and as such the lectures
highlight the work and the mission of the Byzantinist Society of
Cyprus.

The third lecture which is scheduled for Thursday, 9
June at 19:00 (ΕΕΤ) will be offered by Athanasios Markopoulos, Professor
Emeritus of Byzantine Literature at the National and Kapodistrian
University of Athens with the title: "Education in Byzantium" (the
lecture will be given in Greek: "Η Εκπαίδευση στα χρόνια του
Βυζαντίου").
