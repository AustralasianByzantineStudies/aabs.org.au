'Byzantine Studies Alive', a conference on the importance of Byzantine
Studies and Byzantine Heritage, to be held at the Radboud University
Nijmegen, **June 16-17 2016**.

For more information and the
full official call for papers with more information on the contents and
a full description of aims, email Daniëlle Slootjes at
<d.slootjes@let.ru.nl>.

Proposals for papers are welcome on
the following two themes:

**[1) Byzantium as a key player in
the relationship between East and West, A.D. 330
-1453]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}**

Byzantium can
be seen as a leading catalyst in the political, cultural, economic and
religious exchange between East and West, to be detected in the
relationship both between Byzantium and Latin Western Europe and
Byzantium and the Islamic world.

We especially welcome the
papers on this theme to include analyses on

(a) Agents of
exchange such as rulers, bishops, popes, diplomats, pilgrims,
writers  or artists

(b) Objects of transcultural encounter
and transfer such as, (religious) monuments, texts (hagiography,
historiography, liturgical texts, travel accounts)  decorations,
liturgical objects, relics or diplomatic gifts.

These agents
and objects can be regarded as part of the larger historical context
within which Europe took shape in the Middle Ages and
beyond.

**[2) The position of Byzantine heritage,
7th Century - present
day]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}**

The definite end
of the Byzantine Empire is marked by the conquest of Constantinople by
the Ottomans in 1453. Through its history, however, the dimension and
identity of the Empire was not one identical continuum. In different
phases of development (Arab conquests, iconoclasm, Crusaders period)
Byzantine monuments and artefacts were appropriated or under threat, a
phenomenon that continued after the Ottoman conquest.

We
especially welcome the papers on this theme to include analyses
on:

(a) Appropriation and transformation of Byzantine
heritage (objects, monuments, cities)

(b) Display of
Byzantine heritage in Museum Collections

(c) Preservation and
restoration of Byzantine heritage

(d) Byzantine heritage
under threat

Abstracts, no more than 400 words, can be
submitted
to [d.slootjes@let.ru.nl](mailto:d.slootjes@let.ru.nl){target="_blank"}  and [m.verhoeven@let.ru.nl](mailto:m.verhoeven@let.ru.nl){target="_blank"}  before
**1 December 2015**.
