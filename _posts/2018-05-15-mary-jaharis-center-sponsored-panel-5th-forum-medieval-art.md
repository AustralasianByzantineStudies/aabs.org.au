The Mary Jaharis Center for Byzantine Art and Culture seeks
proposals for a Mary Jaharis Center sponsored session at the 5th Forum
Medieval Art, Bern, **September 18--21, 2019**. The biannual colloquium
is organized by the Deutsche Verein für Kunstwissenschaft
e.V.

The theme for the 5th Forum Medieval Art is 'Peaks,
Ponti & Passages'. Bern---looking out to peaks Eiger, Mönch, and
Jungfrau, situated at the border to the Romandy, and having a
long-standing tradition in bridge-building---embodies certain notions of
translations, entanglements, and interactions. The conference will
highlight such themes, focusing on forms and means of exchange,
infrastructure, political and religious relationships, and the concrete
reflections of these connections through objects. Methodological
challenges will also be paramount, such as questioning how to write a
history of encounters between artists, artworks, materials, and
traditions.

Many mountain regions, and especially the Alps,
have a long history as sites of transfers and interferences. Today,
mountains and glaciers are the locations revealing most rapidly the
consequences of climate change. They raise our awareness of similar
changes in the past. Mountain regions were and are traversed by several
ecological networks, connecting cities, regions, and countries, as well
as different cultures, languages, and artistic traditions. Mountains,
with their difficult passages and bridges, structured the ways through
which materials and people were in touch. Bridges were strategic targets
in conduct of war, evidence of applied knowledge, expression of civic
representation, and custom points---both blockades and gates to the
world.

Peaks in the historiography of Art History mark
moments of radical change within artistic developments, the pinnacles of
artistic careers, and high moments in the encounters of different
traditions. Since the unfinished project of Walter Benjamin, who
obtained his PhD in Bern, the passage has also been introduced as a
figure of thought in historiography. The passage describes historical
layers as spatial constellations, in which works of art, everyday
culture, religious ideas, definitions of periods and theories of history
encounter.

We invite session proposals that fit within the
Peaks, Ponti & Passages theme and are relevant to Byzantine studies.
