The Mary Jaharis Center for Byzantine Art and Culture seeks proposals
for a Mary Jaharis Center sponsored session at the 7th Forum Medieval
Art/Forum Kunst des Mittelalters, Jena, **September 25--28, 2024**. The
biannual colloquium is organized by the Deutsche Verein f√ºr
Kunstwissenschaft e.V.

The theme for the 7th Forum Medieval
Art is Light: Art, Metaphysics and Science in the Middle
Ages.

The Mary Jaharis Center invites session proposals that
fit within the Light theme and are relevant to Byzantine
studies.

Session proposals must be submitted through the Mary
Jaharis Center website. The deadline for submission is May 29,
2023.

If the proposed session is approved, the Mary Jaharis
Center will reimburse a maximum of 4 session participants (presenters
and session chair) up to $500 maximum for participants traveling from
locations in Germany, up to $800 maximum for participants traveling
from the EU, and up to $1400 maximum for participants traveling from
outside Europe. Funding is through reimbursement only; advance funding
cannot be provided. Eligible expenses include conference registration,
transportation, and food and lodging. Receipts are required for
reimbursement. The Mary Jaharis Center regrets that it cannot reimburse
participants who have last-minute cancellations and are unable to attend
the conference.
