The Manar al-Athar web site
([www.manar-al-athar.ox.ac.uk](http://www.manar-al-athar.ox.ac.uk)) is
the inspired creation of Judith McKenzie (1957--2019).  It provides high
resolution, searchable images for teaching, research and publication. 
These images of  archaeological sites, buildings and art cover the areas
of the former Roman empire which later came under Islamic rule, such as
Syro-Palestine/the Levant, Egypt and North Africa, as well as some
bordering regions, such as Georgia and Armenia.  The chronological
 range is from Alexander the Great (i.e. from about 300 BC) through the
Islamic period.  It is the first web site of its kind providing such
material labelled jointly in both Arabic and English.

Manar
al-Athar currently has c. 65 000 images online, but the web site is in
continuous development.  Current strengths include Late Antiquity
 (250--750 AD), the period of transition from paganism to Christianity
and then to Islam, especially religious buildings (temples, churches,
synagogues, mosques) and monumental art (including floor mosaics), early
Islamic art (paintings, mosaics, relief sculpture),  as well as Roman
and early Islamic (Umayyad) architecture and evidence of
iconoclasm.

While Manar al-Athar is not an exclusively
Byzantine resource, a significant proportion of the material currently
available through the web site is late antique/Byzantine.
