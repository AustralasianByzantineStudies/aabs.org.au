Macquarie University, **November 15 2017**




Building W3A, Room 328 (Moot Court)


I am organising an informal work-in-progress day on the topic of
Late Roman and Early Byzantine Politics, to enable scholars of this
period in Australasia to meet, hear papers on each other's research and
exchange ideas.

Papers of up to 30 minutes are invited by
academics and advanced graduate students on the topic of late Roman and
early Byzantine politics (c. 300-600AD).

Please send
prospective titles and a short abstract of up to 100 words to
[meaghan.mcevoy@mq.edu.au](mailto:meaghan.mcevoy@mq.edu.au) by Friday **13 October
2017**.

Registration will be free, with tea and coffee and
lunch provided for all attendees, thanks to generous sponsorship by the
Ancient Cultures Research Centre at Macquarie University. Space is
limited, however, so please RSVP to confirm attendance, even if not
giving a paper. Exact starting and finishing times will be determined by
the number of papers. All welcome!

Meaghan McEvoy, Department
of Ancient History, Macquarie University.
