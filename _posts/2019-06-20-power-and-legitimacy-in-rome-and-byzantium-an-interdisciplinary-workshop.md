The fields of Roman and Byzantine studies have developed as
largely separate fields. Historians and classicists have typically
treated Rome and Byzantium as two distinct empires, and rarely do the
two fields intersect. Nevertheless, the subjects of study for both
fields, from the early Republic to the last years of the Palaiologan
Dynasty considered themselves to be first and foremost Romans, part of a
polity stretching back to the mythical age of kings, and their leaders
considered themselves to be the successors of emperors dating back to
Augustus and relied on similar methods to secure their legitimacy.
Whether gaining the support of the military, employing popular religion,
using numismatic iconography and statuary, or employing rhetoric and
panegyric, the tools used by Roman and Byzantine leaders to acquire and
maintain authority changed very little in form over
time.

This workshop seeks to bring together established
scholars and students of any field examining the topics of Roman and
Byzantine legitimacy, broadly conceived, to share ideas and promote
cooperation.

Possible topics may include but [are not limited
to]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}: The use of imperial cult,
church and state relations, relationship between the emperor and the
military, the emperor and the people, imperial ritual, coinage, statuary
and monuments, identity, succession and usurpation, social networking,
rhetoric, panegyric and propaganda, etc.
