The Mashtots Professor of Armenian Studies at Harvard University and the
Mary Jaharis Center for Byzantine Art and Culture at Hellenic College
Holy Cross in Brookline, MA, are pleased to invite abstracts for the
next Studying East of Byzantium workshop: Studying East of Byzantium IX:
Networks.

A three-part workshop that intends to bring
together doctoral students and very recent PhDs studying the Christian
East to reflect on how to reflect on the usefulness of networks in
studying the Christian East, to share methodologies, and to discuss
their research with workshop respondents, Zara Pogossian, University of
Florence, and Joel Walker, University of Washington. The workshop will
meet on **November 18, 2022, February 17, 2023, and June 12--13, 2023**,
on Zoom. The timing of the workshop meetings will be determined when the
participant list is finalized.

We invite all graduate
students and recent PhDs working in the Christian East whose work
considers, or hopes to consider, the theme of networks (microregional,
regional, transregional, global, etc.) in their own research to
apply.

Participation is limited to 10 students. The full
workshop description is available on the East of Byzantium website
([https://eastofbyzantium.org/upcoming-events/](https://eastofbyzantium.org/upcoming-events/){target="_blank"}).
Those interested in attending should submit a C.V. and 200-word abstract
through the East of Byzantium website no later than September 19,
2022.
