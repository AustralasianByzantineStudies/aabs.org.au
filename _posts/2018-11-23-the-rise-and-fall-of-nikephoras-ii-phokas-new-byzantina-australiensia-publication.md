In
*The Rise and Fall of Nikephoros II Phokas*, Denis Sullivan presents
five Byzantine Greek texts that document the remarkable career of
Nikephoros II Phokas, emperor from 963 until his death in 969.  The
first three texts are historical chronicles covering the period 944-963,
which sees Nikephoras' rise from military general.  The fourth is a
"historical epic" poem on the successful Byzantine expedition against
Arab Crete in 960-961, for which Nikephoros was the field commander. 
The last text is a liturgical office that declares the slain emperor a
martyr and a saint.  These texts, translated into English for the first
time, provide information on the Phokades that is not found elsewhere in
the Greek sources, and the chronicles appear to reflect now lost
pro-Phokan family sources.
