[Conference
website](https://www.imc.leeds.ac.uk/imc-2022/).

The IMC
provides an interdisciplinary forum for the discussion of all aspects of
Medieval Studies. Proposals on any topic related to the Middle Ages are
welcome, while every year the IMC also chooses a special thematic focus.
In 2022 this is 'Borders'.

Medieval borders have preoccupied
scholars for several decades in various guises. The term 'border'
designates a wide variety of phenomena: physical geographical limits,
that can be signalled by border markers or natural features, points
where toll has to be paid, political boundaries, that vary from points
in space to linear and fortified military fronts, ways of controlling
space, frontier zones, borderlands, porous zones of encounters and
contact, ways of limiting community and identity, ideological and
metaphorical delimitation including discourse and representation,
bordering practices, the process of creating and performing borders, and
borderscapes to capture fluidity and change over time.
