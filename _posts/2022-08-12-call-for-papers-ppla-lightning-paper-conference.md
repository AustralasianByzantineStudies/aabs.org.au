title: Call For Papers: PPLA Lightning Paper Conference
date: 2022-08-12
---

Following on the success of our lightning paper panels at the Pacific
Partnership for Late Antiquity Zoom conference earlier this year, we
will host another Zoom conference on **November 12-13 2022** (North
American dates) as a way to present some ideas related to current
research.  The format will follow that of the lightning papers - 5
minutes for presenting the paper, 10 minutes for discussion of each
paper.  If you are interested in presenting a paper or a panel of
papers, please submit a short (150 word) abstract to [Lisa
Bailey](mailto:lk.bailey@auckland.ac.nz){auth="NotApplicable"} by
**October 1**.  Please circulate to any graduate students; we are
particularly keen to encourage graduate student participation!
