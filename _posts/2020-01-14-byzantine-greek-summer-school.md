The
Byzantine Studies Research Center is pleased to announce the
organization of its fourth Byzantine Greek Summer School program to be
held at Boğaziçi University, Istanbul, Turkey, from July 6 to July 24,
2020. Students will have the chance to participate in an intensive
program in Medieval Greek with Prof. Niels Gaul and Dr. Athanasia
Stavrou, while enjoying various attractions of the Boğaziçi University
campus on the Bosphorus and the Byzantine sites of Istanbul.


### Format


The program is designed for students who have completed at least
two semesters of college-level Classical Greek or its equivalent.
Students are expected to have knowledge of basic Greek grammar and to be
able to read simple texts from ancient Greek or Byzantine literature.
Morning classes are devoted to the reading of Byzantine texts with a
focus on Constantinopolitan monuments and/or events that happened in the
city, and will be held in two groups, at lower intermediate level and
upper intermediate/advanced level. Students will be assigned to one of
the two groups based on their performance in a prognostic test. Morning
classes will be supplemented by tutorial sessions in the afternoons that
offer revisions of grammar or a brief introduction to Greek paleography.
 In addition to coursework, the program offers weekend and afternoon
excursions to the sites/monuments of Constantinople; every student will
be asked to briefly introduce in situ a monument or event relevant to
the history of the Byzantine city. The language of instruction is
English. Students will receive a certificate of participation upon
successful completion of the program.


### Instructors


Niels Gaul is the A. G. Leventis Professor of Byzantine Studies at
the University of Edinburgh. He is currently interested in the
socio-political functions of (classicizing) learning in medieval
polities -- inter alia as the PI of a major ERC-funded project that
explores such issues in the Byzantine and Tang/Song empires from a
cross-cultural vantage point -- and pursues various smaller projects on
the side, e.g. on the often unexpected connections between Byzantium and
Scotland from the early middle ages to the present day, or relic
translations in the age of Constantine VII
Porphyrogennetos.

Athanasia Stavrou is a Visiting Scholar at
the Byzantine Studies Research Center, Boğaziçi University. Her research
interests lie in the social and economic history of the Late Byzantine
period, particularly in relation to family property rights. She has long
experience in teaching Classical, Medieval and Modern Greek in various
educational institutions in the United Kingdom, and taught at the
International Byzantine Greek Summer School for three years. From 2017
to 2019 she was the Onassis Visiting Instructor of Ancient and Modern
Greek at the Department of History, Boğaziçi University.


### Location


Classes will be held at the Byzantine Studies Research Center,
located on the main campus of Boğaziçi University. Established as Robert
College in 1863, Boğaziçi University is one of the leading institutions
of higher education in Turkey. Its Byzantine Studies Research Center,
founded in 2015, is the first Turkish institution attached to a state
university that is dedicated to academic research on Byzantine
civilization. The Center fosters the development of education in
Byzantine studies by offering scholarships at the MA, PhD, and
postdoctoral levels, "tools of the trade" seminars, and language
programs.
