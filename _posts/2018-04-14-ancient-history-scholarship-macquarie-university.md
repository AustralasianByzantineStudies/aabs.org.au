## The History of Inebriation and Reason from Plato to the Latin Middle Ages


This project explores the creative tension that emerged in the
Greek culture between a negative view of inebriation as falling away
from reason and the development of a positive, metaphorical sense of
inebriation as the transformation of consciousness, transcending the
limitations of reason.  I argue that starting with Plato this tension
gave rise to two powerful metaphors: inebriation as a description of
spiritual elevation and drinking blood as a description of erroneous
spiritual quests.  The project examines the development of these
metaphors in the Greek and Roman literatures as well as their reception
in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance up to the fifteenth century.   By
informing major philosophical and theological debates of the centuries
under examination as well as the poetics of the genres that expressed
them the image of drinking can contribute significantly to redrawing the
map of pre-modern intellectual history through a unique
lens.

The successful candidate is asked to develop a project
that is relevant (broadly defined) to the future fellowship topic: for
example, candidates can choose to research the role of wine in
pre-Socratic philosophy or Greek Lyric poetry; the reception of Platonic
inebriation in Byzantine philosophy or as late as Ficino.  Candidates
interested in the Biblical tradition of wine are also invited to apply. 
All candidates are encouraged to discuss their project with the
prospective supervisor prior to applying.
