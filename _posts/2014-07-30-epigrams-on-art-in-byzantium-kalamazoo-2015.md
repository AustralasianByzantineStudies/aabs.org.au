Sponsor: Mary Jaharis Center for Byzantine Art and
Culture

Papers are invited for Epigrams on Art in Byzantium,
a Mary Jaharis Center sponsored session at the 50th International
Congress on Medieval Studies, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo,
**May 14--17 2015**.

The cohabitation and synergy of the
physical object and the inscribed verse was a common facet of daily life
in Byzantium. From monumental architecture to pieces of jewelry, seals,
and even coins, a range of Byzantine objects bore verse inscriptions, or
epigrams. While philologists and literary historians have furthered our
understanding of Byzantine epigrammatic poetry in recent years, art
historians have only begun to integrate the evidence of epigrams in the
study of Byzantine art, aesthetics, and material culture. There is a
great deal to be learned from engaging with this tremendously rich yet
lamentably understudied evidence. How does the epigram inflect,
transform, and empower the object it accompanies? How does it frame or
guide the viewer's sensorial, cognitive, and emotional responses? If
poetic inscriptions, as scholars have convincingly argued, were commonly
read aloud by the Byzantines, how does the experience of the epigram as
performed speech affect the viewer's interaction with the object? What
is the ritual dimension of inscribed verse and how may it relate to
liturgical rites, commemorative prayers, solemn vows, or magical
incantations? What is the agency of poetic inscriptions beyond verbal
communication? What role does the visual aspect, materiality, and
spatial presentation of the written word play in making the inscription
"legible"? How does the epigram function as a social tool, a site for
the construction of identity for the object's commissioner, donor, or
maker? Can we speak about an epigrammatic discourse on art, and if yes,
how does this discourse interact with or differ from the discourses on
art formulated in theology and rhetoric? This session seeks
contributions that take a fresh and penetrating look at the complex
interplay between art and epigrammatic poetry in Byzantine
culture.
