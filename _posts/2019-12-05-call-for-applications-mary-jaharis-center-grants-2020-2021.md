The Mary Jaharis Center for Byzantine Art and Culture is pleased to
announce its 2020--2021 grant competition, including a new grant for
archaeological projects. Our grants reflect the Mary Jaharis Center's
commitment to fostering the field of Byzantine studies through the
support of graduate students and early career researchers and
faculty.

**Mary Jaharis Center Dissertation Grants** are
awarded to advanced graduate students working on Ph.D. dissertations in
the field of Byzantine studies broadly conceived. These grants are meant
to help defray the costs of research-related expenses, e.g., travel,
photography/digital images, microfilm.

**Mary Jaharis Center
Publication Grants** support book-length publications or major articles
in the field of Byzantine studies broadly conceived. Grants are aimed at
early career academics. Preference will be given to postdocs and
assistant professors, though applications from non-tenure track faculty
and associate and full professors will be considered. We encourage the
submission of first-book projects.

**Mary Jaharis Center
Project Grants** support discrete and highly focused professional
projects aimed at the conservation, preservation, and documentation of
Byzantine archaeological sites and monuments dated from 300 CE to 1500
CE primarily in Greece and Turkey. Projects may be small stand-alone
projects or discrete components of larger projects. Eligible projects
might include archeological investigation, excavation, or survey;
documentation, recovery, and analysis of at risk materials (e.g.,
architecture, mosaics, paintings in situ); and preservation (i.e.,
preventive measures, e.g., shelters, fences, walkways, water management)
or conservation (i.e., physical hands-on treatments) of sites,
buildings, or objects.

The application deadline for all
grants is **February 1, 2020**. For further information, please see
