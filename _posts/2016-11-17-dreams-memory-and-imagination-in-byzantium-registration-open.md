In
the last two decades, the role of dreams, memory and the imagination in
the ancient world and its cultural productions have come to receive
increased attention, along with the importance of emotions in the
Greco-Roman and medieval worlds. This conference will focus on the ways
that the Byzantine imagination shaped its dreams and memories from the
fourth to fifteenth centuries and the many ways in which these were
recorded in the Byzantine world, in its historiography, literature,
religion, art and architecture.

Professor Derek Krueger of
Greensboro University, North Carolina, will be our guest speaker at this
international conference.
