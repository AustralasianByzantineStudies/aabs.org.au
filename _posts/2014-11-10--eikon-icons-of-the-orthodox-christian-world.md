The rich tradition of Eastern Christian spirituality and
imagery will be celebrated with the special exhibition [*EIKON: Icons of
the Orthodox Christian
World*](http://www.artgalleryofballarat.com.au/exhibitions-and-events/exhibitions/eikon-icons-of-the-orthodox-christian-world.aspx).

Discover
the extraordinary power of icons, which have sustained and shaped belief
in different times and contexts, sometimes against significant odds.
Icons are beautiful sacred portraits, glowing with rich colours and gold
leaf, but for Orthodox Christians they also represent the Divine
Presence - they have been referred to as 'windows on
Heaven'.

EIKON brings eighty high quality works, including
some really sumptuous examples of Orthodox art. Most of the icons in the
show originate from Greece and Russia, with examples as well from
Cyprus, Syria and Palestine and range in time from the twelfth to the
beginning of the nineteenth centuries.

Viewing the exhibition
will be a special event, with dramatic lighting and a soundscape
incorporating traditional chanting, bells and other sounds of an
Orthodox service, recreating the original setting of the
works.

The exhibition draws mainly from the magnificent
private collection of former Australian diplomat John McCarthy, with
additional loans from the National Gallery of Victoria, from the Abbey
Museum of Art and Archaeology in Queensland and from Sir Richard Temple
Bt, whose Temple Gallery in London is a leading centre for the study,
restoration and exhibition of ancient icons and sacred
art.

EIKON will be accompanied by a lavishly illustrated
catalogue, as well as specially produced Christmas cards and other
souvenirs. There will also be a schedule of education and public
programs, including concerts of Greek and Russian-inspired
music.

Join one of the Gallery's dedicated Guides on a
special tour through the exhibition to hear some of the stories behind
the artworks. Tours will run at 11.30am from Wednesdays to Sundays
during the run of the exhibition.

Tickets Adult $15,
Concession $10, Gallery Member $7.50, Group (10+) $9 each, Child
(U16) Free.
