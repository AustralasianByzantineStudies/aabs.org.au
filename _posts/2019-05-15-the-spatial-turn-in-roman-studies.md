We
announce two international conferences plus a year-long programme of
events in Durham on the theme 'The spatial turn in Roman studies'. This
is the call for papers for the Auckland conference, 22-24 January 2020.
A call for papers for the Durham conference will follow.

We
plan a series of events reflecting on a generation's worth of work on
the spatial turn in Roman studies and seeking out the best new
scholarship arising from it.

The goal of our programme of
events is a double one: first, to gain an overview of the directions
research has taken, identify underlying themes and trends, and describe
successful spatial methodology as a guideline for future work; second,
to move beyond what has been done and explore the full potential of
spatial approaches, especially by bringing together work that has taken
the same body of spatial theory in different directions. The most
pressing divide we see is between work on historical and archaeological
space on the one hand, and imagined and literary space on the other:
they represent two well-developed bodies of scholarship in Roman
studies, both often drawing on the same set of 20th-century spatial
theory, but not often in conversation with each other. We seek to
address the questions: could more be done to bring them together and
pool their insights, or does the problem lie in the way the underlying
spatial theories fail to bring together real and imagined
space?

The Auckland conference will include research papers,
seminars with pre-circulated readings from major thinkers in spatial
theory, and keynote addresses from Ray Laurence, Nandini Pandey, and
Diana Spencer. This call is for those interested in delivering 20-minute
research papers on any topic related to the spatial turn in Roman
studies. Papers should present new research grounded in spatial
methodologies; they could be historical, literary, archaeological,
philosophical, or all four and more, and could cover any aspect of the
Roman Mediterranean from the archaic period to late antiquity, but
should reflect the impact of the spatial turn on their scholarly
context. Please send a 300-word abstract as an email attachment to BOTH
<amy.russell@dur.ac.uk> AND <maxine.lewis@auckland.ac.nz> by **28 June
2019**, with the subject header 'The spatial turn in Roman studies:
Auckland'. We welcome proposals for innovative presentation formats, and
are keen to hear from speakers of all career stages and from any
discipline.

It is our ambition to pay for flights within
Australasia and accommodation during the conference period for all
speakers. Please note that the conference for the Australasian Society
for Classical Studies (ASCS) will be held in Otago, New Zealand, the
following week. If speakers are flying from outside Australasia to
attend both our conference and ASCS, we aim to pay for your transport
between Auckland and Otago.

Prospective speakers from the
northern hemisphere should consider waiting to apply to the Durham
conference, to reduce the total amount of air travel required. We hope
to support virtual attendance for some sessions via Skype or similar,
but those giving papers should plan to attend in person.
