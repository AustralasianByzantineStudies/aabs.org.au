Outlandish Knight: The Byzantine Life of Steven Runciman by [Minoo
Dinshaw](https://www.lrb.co.uk/search?author=Dinshaw,+Minoo). Penguin,
767 pp, £30.00, September 2016, ISBN 978 0 241 00493 7

This
is a book that will interest the general public as well as
Byzantinists.  It has a particular resonance for me, because I met Sir
Steven briefly when he visited Western Australia in 1960, and at one or
two conferences after that, and when I sent him a copy of my first
Byzantine book he wrote a very pleasant complimentary letter to
me.

For a description of the book, see [Penguin's
advertisement](https://www.penguin.com.au/books/outlandish-knight-9780141979472)
and a review in the [London Review of
Books](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n20/rosemary-hill/herberts-and-herbertinas);
also a partial preview (which will make clear the excellent writing
style of the author) at [Google
Books](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=d__cCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT11&lpg=PT11&dq=order+whirling+dervishes+runciman&source=bl&ots=wJoKt-owiN&sig=rCDuwj66HlH1kMFxDMZmt2aRnG4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiitvutn7HaAhVLlZQKHeMvBSoQ6AEIOjAH#v=onepage&q=order%20whirling%20dervishes%20runciman&f=false).

The
book documents the extraordinary life of someone who made Byzantine
history much more 'popular' than it had been in the
past.
