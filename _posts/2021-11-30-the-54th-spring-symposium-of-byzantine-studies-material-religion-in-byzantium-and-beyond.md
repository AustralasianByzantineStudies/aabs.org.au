date: 2021-11-30
---

**18-20 March 2022**, Corpus Christus College & All Souls College,
Oxford (deadline 10th December).

The 54th Annual Spring
Symposium in Byzantine Studies will be held in Oxford on the theme of
Material Religion in Byzantium and Beyond. The Symposium brings together
Byzantine studies with a series of innovative approaches to the material
nature and realities of religion -- foregrounding the methodological,
historical and archaeological problems of studying religion through
visual and material culture. Taking a broad geographical and
chronological view of the Byzantine world, the Symposium will range
across Afro-Eurasia and from Antiquity to the period after the fall of
Constantinople. Panels will be arranged around the themes of 'Objects in
motion', 'Religion in 3D', 'Religious landscapes', 'Things without
context', 'Things and their context' and 'Spatial approaches to
religion'.

In addition to the customary panel papers, an
inaugural lecture and a closing lecture for a wider public, we now
invite Communications of 10 minutes in duration on current research in
fields linked to the theme of the Symposium. Please send your abstract
(of not more than 300 words) to Ine Jacobs
([Ine.Jacobs@univ.ox.ac.uk](mailto:Ine.Jacobs@univ.ox.ac.uk){target="_blank"})
by **10 December 2021**.
