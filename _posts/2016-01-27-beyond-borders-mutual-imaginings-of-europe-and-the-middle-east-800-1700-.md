title: Beyond Borders: Mutual Imaginings of Europe and the Middle East (800-1700)
date: 2016-01-27

Barnard College's 25th Biannual Medieval and Renaissance Studies
Conference, **December 3 2016**

Recent scholarship is
challenging the stark border between Europe and the Middle East during
the long period between 800-1700. Rather than thinking of these areas in
isolation, scholars are revealing the depth of their mutual influence.
Trade, war, migration, and scholarly exchange connected Europe and the
Middle East in ways both cooperative and adversarial. The distant world
was not only an object of aggression, but also, inextricably, of fantasy
and longing. Jewish, Muslim and Christian thinkers looked to each other
to understand their own cultural histories and to imagine their futures.
Bringing together art historians, literary scholars, historians,
scholars of the history of science, and scholars of religious thought,
this interdisciplinary conference will explore the real and imaginary
cultural interchanges between Europe and the Middle East during their
formative periods. The conference will feature plenary lectures by
Professors Nancy Bisaha of Vassar College and Nabil Matar of the
University of Minnesota.

This conference is being organized
by Professors Rachel Eisendrath, Najam Haider and Laurie Postlewate of
Barnard College.

Please send an abstract (with title) of
approximately 200 words and CV to
[lpostlew@barnard.edu](mailto:lpostlew@barnard.edu){target="_blank"}.
Presentations should be 20 minutes.

Deadline: **April 10,
2016**.
