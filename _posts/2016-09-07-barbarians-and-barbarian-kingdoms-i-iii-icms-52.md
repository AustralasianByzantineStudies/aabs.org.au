   Barbarians and Barbarian Kingdoms I-III: ICMS 52
date: 2016-09-07

Kalamazoo, MI, **May 11-14 2017**

Debate remains lively
concerning the barbarians of late antiquity, their impact on late Roman
civilization (and its impact on them), and the manifold continuities and
discontinuities within their early medieval kingdoms.  Scholars of all
levels are thus invited to submit an abstract for one of three sessions
at ICMS 52 that will focus on "Barbarians and Barbarian
Kingdoms."  These sessions are intentionally broad in scope, allowing
for a disparate range of topics that might focus on a specific region,
time, or development; comment on a vast array of written and/or material
sources; or treat a particular theme, person, or event.  What they will
all have in common is barbarians and/or barbarian kingdoms, c.
350-700.

Please direct inquiries or abstracts with a
completed Participant Information Form (here:
