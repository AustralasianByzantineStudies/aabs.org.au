### **BYZANTINE EPIGRAPHY: TEXTS AND CONTEXTS**


ANDREAS RHOBY (Austrian Academy of Sciences)
IDA TOTH (Oxford
University)

**4-5 NOVEMBER 2018**

It is well known
and widely acknowledged that many aspects of ancient Greek and Roman
civilization can be accessed only through inscriptional source material.
Administrative and legislative actions, and the acts of beneficence,
commemoration, and thanksgiving all depended for their promulgation on
publically displayed and highly visible epigraphs. Such traditions
continued throughout Late Antiquity, a time during which inscriptions
still functioned as official announcements as well as becoming an
effective way to confess, express, and spread the new religion endorsed
by the Roman State - Christianity. Even after Late Antiquity (ca. AD
600), inscriptions persisted as regular features of Byzantine written
culture until, as well as beyond, the fall of Constantinople in 1453.
Although there was some decline in the production of stone and mosaic
inscriptions, new epigraphic media were employed, such as monumental
fresco inscriptions and epigrams on movable objects. Byzantium preserved
earlier and produced new inscriptional material: this epigraphic
heritage encompasses multiple habits and traditions, and it draws
meaning from its distinct archeological, iconographic, topographical,
and historical contexts.
The two-day seminar, organized by the
Bogazici University Byzantine Studies Research Center, will address a
wide range of issues relating to Byzantine epigraphic traditions with an
aim to show how diverse kinds of inscribed writings contribute to our
knowledge of the society and culture that produced them.

The
classes, held in English, will take place at the Byzantine Studies
Research Center and in a number of Byzantine sites in Istanbul.
Participants will receive a certificate at the end of the
program.

**The deadline for application is 26 October 2018**.
