Assoc. Prof. Drijvers is a distinguished scholar of
late Roman studies, whose many publications range from seminal works on
the empress Helena, mother of the first Christian emperor Constantine,
to a series of scholarly commentaries on the key late Roman historian
Ammianus Marcellinus, and studies of the Syriac Julian Romance.  His
current research projects include a monograph on the emperor Jovian and
new commentaries on the *Panegyrici Latini*.  This is his first visit to
Australia and offers a crucial opportunity for students of Roman and
late antique studies in particular to benefit from his expertise in this
area.
