title: Editing Late-Antique and Early Medieval Texts: Problems and Challenges
date: 2016-12-13
---

International Workshop, University of Lisbon, **23-24 November
2017**

This workshop aims at fostering and promoting the
exchange of ideas on how to edit Late-Antique and Early-Medieval texts.
By presenting case-studies, participants will be encouraged to share the
editorial problems and methodological challenges that they had to face
in order to fulfil their research or critical editions. Troublesome
issues will be addressed like how to edit, for instance,
- an
'open' text or a 'fluid' one (as in the case of some glossaries,
grammatical texts, chronicles or scientific treatises),
- a Latin
text translated from another language, like Greek, or bilingual texts
(like some hagiographic texts, hermeneumata, Latin translations of Greek
medical treatises, etc.),
- a text with variants by the author or
in double recensions,
- a text with linguistic instability,
-
a collection of extracts,
- a lost text recoverable from scanty
remnants or fragments,
- a text transmitted by a codex unicus or,
on the contrary, a text transmitted by a huge number of
manuscripts,
- a text with a relevant indirect tradition,
-
homiliaries and passionaires as collections of selected
texts.

Attention will be devoted as well to different aspects
of editorial practice and textual criticism.

Keynote
speakers:
Carmen Codoñer (U. Salamanca), Paolo Chiesa (U. Milano),
Charles Burnett (Warburg Institute).

The papers should be 30
minutes in length and will focus on the edition of late-antique and
early Medieval texts, in particular on editions currently in
preparation, forthcoming or recently concluded. The scientific committee
will select a number of proposals to be presented and discussed during
the workshop. The papers can be presented in English, French, Italian
and Spanish.

An abstract of around 200 words, including the
name, institution and email, should be sent before **May 30, 2017** to:
<Lisbonworshop17@letras.ulisboa.pt>.
Acceptance of the papers will
be communicated until June 30, 2017.
