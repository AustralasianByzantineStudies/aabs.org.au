Byzantium was an empire
on, and of, the ancient Mediterranean and Black seas. Romans of this
'late' empire inherited a political, military and cultural system of
waterborne trade and interconnections centred on the harbour city of
Byzantium. Constantine's new capital city of Constantinople swiftly
replaced Rome as the Mediterranean entrepot of goods from east and west,
building on the foundations of Byzantium, once the ideal Greek
*emporium*. We seek papers engaging with this topic on any level of
analysis, from history to hagiography, the city to the empire, and from
letters, art and iconography to harbour architecture or fishermen's
saints. Papers could consider (among other topics) Severan Byzantium,
the Greek colony or Istanbul; maritime aspects of the Roman empire
centred on Constantinople from the 4th to the 15th centuries; or
Byzantium's legacy in the Black Sea, on the Aegean islands, in the
Italian maritime republics, or along the rivers, bays and coasts to her
northeast, south or west.
