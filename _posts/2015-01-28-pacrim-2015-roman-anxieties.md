   PACRIM 2015: Roman Anxieties
date: 2015-01-28
---

The theme for the 2015 Pacific Rim Seminar for Roman Literature is Roman
Anxieties. If you wish to offer a paper, please submit a 300-word
abstract
to [mj.wilson@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:mj.wilson@auckland.ac.nz).

Roman
literature manifests and thematises anxiety in a variety of ways; the
sources of Roman anxieties were themselves widely varied. We invite
proposals for papers on any aspect of the theme 'Roman anxieties' in
Latin literature and related fields. The Roman anxieties under
discussion could relate to the following issues: social and political
change; ethical uncertainties; gender and sexuality; ethnic, cultural or
religious identity; literary influence and belatedness.

This
list is not exhaustive nor intended to be prescriptive. Moreover, the
topic is not limited to material from the Classical period. We welcome
papers on 'Roman anxieties' that deal with the reception of Rome and
Roman literature in literary, artistic, scholarly and pedagogical
contexts ranging from Late Antiquity to the present day.

We
hope to arrange a joint session with the Australasian Applied and
Professional Ethics Conference, which will be running concurrently at
Auckland with the Pacific Rim Seminar. We invite expressions of interest
from anyone interested in offering a short presentation that seeks to
compare or contrast the treatment of ethical anxieties, or social roles
or identities in Roman texts to the way they are conceived in the modern
world.

**Format: **The Pacific Rim Seminar does not run
parallel sessions, so participants can attend any or all papers. Papers
may be 20 minutes with ten minutes of discussion time, or 40 minutes
with 20 minutes of discussion time. In your abstract please specify
whether you prefer a 20 or 40 minute presentation slot. The deadline for
abstracts is the 31st of March, but earlier submissions are welcome and
will be responded to within two weeks of
submission.

**Dates:** Wed to Fri **8-10 July
2015
Conference fee**: NZ$100, with a concession rate of NZ$60
for postgraduate and unwaged attendees.
