Organizer: Paul Kimball, Bilkent

Sponsored by the Society for Late
Antiquity

Near the turn of the last millennium two
collections of essays appeared which called our attention to late
antique panegyric.*The Propaganda of Power: The Role of Panegyric in
Late Antiquity*, ed. Mary Whitby (1998) underlined the genre's public
and political contexts, while *Greek Biography and Panegyric in Late
Antiquity*, edd. Thomas Hägg and Philip Rousseau (2000) explored its
links with the forms and practices of biography and hagiography. The
contributions to both volumes made it clear that from origins in the
fourth century BCE to the end of antiquity (and beyond), panegyric
proved a long-lived and highly adaptable platform for the articulation
of social relations and the values that supported them. At the meeting
of the Society for Classical Studies in Boston, Massachusetts from **4-7
January 2018**, the Society for Late Antiquity will sponsor a session to
revisit the significance of the rhetoric of praise in late antiquity. We
are especially interested in proposals that examine what, if anything,
was distinctively "late antique" about late antique panegyric and
encomium. In addition to papers addressing this specific question, we
also welcome submissions on all aspects of these genres in late
antiquity: theory and practice, political and private contexts, literary
and declamatory presentations, prose and verse, parodic and ironic,
etc.

Abstracts for papers requiring a maximum of twenty
minutes to deliver should be sent no later than **February 15, 2017**by
email attachment to Paul Kimball at
[pkimball@bilkent.edu.tr](mailto:pkimball@bilkent.edu.tr).
All submissions will be judged anonymously by two referees. Prospective
panelists must be members in good standing of the SCS at the time of
submission and must include their membership number in the cover letter
accompanying their abstract. Please follow the SCS's instructions for
the format of individual abstracts:
[https://classicalstudies.org/annual-meeting/guidelines-authors-abstracts](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/6eKvBwH7n11XSV?domain=classicalstudies.org).
The submission of an abstract represents a commitment to attend the 2018
meeting should the abstract be accepted. No papers will be read *in
absentia* and the SLA is unable to provide funding for travel to
Boston.
