The work of applicants should encompass religion, broadly
conceived, in the medieval and early modern periods. The recent round of
appointments established strengths in late medieval and early modern
Italy and the Low Countries, late medieval and early modern Central
Europe, early modern France, the twelfth-century Anglo-Norman world, and
the history of the papacy; the cultures of time, religious violence,
theology and literature, women's spirituality, popular religion,
politics, and theology.

With this further round of
appointments, the MEMS Program seeks scholars whose work will complement
and expand these strengths. Applicants to the first round are welcome to
re-apply.
