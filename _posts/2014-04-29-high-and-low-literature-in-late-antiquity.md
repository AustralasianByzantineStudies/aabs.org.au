International Society for Late Antique Literary Studies second annnual
conference, Boston University, **November 14-15,
2014**

The
second annual conference of the International Society for Late Antique
Literary Studies (ISLALS) will convene on the campus of Boston
University on November 14-15 2014. The theme of the conference is High
and Low Literature in Late Antiquity. We seek papers that examine what
constituted "high" and "low" literature in late antiquity. Can and
should we separate the two categories?  What areas of late antique
literature confirm or problematize this distinction? How did late
antique authors think about the high and the low? How did they use the
categories rhetorically? How, historically, have critics brought those
categories to bear on the reception of late antique literature? If you
would like to participate, please send an abstract of your paper via
email attachment to the steering committee by **August 15 2014**:
<smcgill@rice.edu>, <Joseph_Pucci@brown.edu>, <dbright@emory.edu>.
Papers should be no more than thirty minutes in
length.

ISLALS requires no dues and there is no registration
fee for the conference. ISLALS will provide refreshments during the
conference. All other meals as well as lodging and travel will be the
responsibility of participants. A closing banquet for all conference
participants, at a set price, will round out this year's gathering.
Please send queries about conference particulars to James Uden at
<uden@bu.edu>. General queries about ISLALS may be sent to any member of
the steering committee.
