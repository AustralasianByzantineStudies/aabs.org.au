The Committee of the Australasian Association for Byzantine Studies has
written to the International Association of Byzantine Studies (AIEB) on
behalf of the Association concerning the change in status of Hagia
Sophia and the Chora Monastery.Â  The text of the letter follows.




_____________________________________________


Dear AIEB President Haldon, Secretary Markopoulos, and Treasurer
Caseau,

On behalf of the Executive Committee of the
Australasian Association for Byzantine Studies (AABS), and the
Australian National Byzantine Committee, we join in expressing our
concern about the recent change in Hagia Sophia's status, from almost a
century as a museum, to again be used as an active and functioning
mosque. We have a particular concern for the Byzantine art, especially
mosaics, and the preservation of the fabric of the building under its
new administration.

This conversion is part of a worrying
recent trend in the Republic of Turkey, which includes the handover of
Istanbul's Chora Monastery Church/Kariye Mosque from museum to mosque
status, and the announcement that the extensive Byzantine mosaics in the
latter building will be covered by curtains and may be inaccessible to
visitors outside of prayer times.

We hope you will register
our National Committee's concern at this change, and the negative
impact it could have upon scholarly work and visitor experiences of both
Hagia Sophia and the Chora/Kariye Church/Mosque/Museum in the near
future.

We thank you for your leadership of the AIEB on this
important issue facing Byzantine Studies and Byzantinists worldwide this
year.

Sincerely,
Dr. Amelia R.
