The Association
Internationale des Études Byzantines (AIEB) will hold its next congress,
the 23rd International Congress of Byzantine Studies, in Belgrade from
**22-27 August, 2016**. The members of the Serbian National Committee
for Byzantine Studies, as well as all Byzantinists and medievalists of
Serbia, are proud that the Belgrade school for Byzantine studies is to
be entrusted again with the organization of this congress. We warmly
welcome Byzantine scholars from around the world to participate and
contribute to this important exchange of ideas and thereby establish the
present state of research in Byzantine studies.

The upcoming
congress will focus on deepening the understanding of Byzantium (the
Byzantine Empire) as a living organism that lasted for more than a
millenium and in which ideology, erudition, art and culture essentially
contributed to the deveolpment of Europe from the Late Antique and
Medieval period up to the present day. The congress will also offer
young researchers the opportunity to share their ideas and projects for
future research on Byzantium. Bearing all this in mind, the
Réunion-Intercongrès held in Athens in September 2013 accepted the name
and motto of the Congress suggested by the organizers. Both elements
emphasize the above-mentioned need for understanding Byzantium as a
complex organism that calls for innovative approaches to the future
research.

The president of the Republic of Serbia, Tomislav
Nikolić, will act as patron for the International Congress due to its
importance for scientific research in Serbia and for the cultural
identity of the country, for which the organizing body would like to
expresses its deep gratitude. In addition, because of the scientific and
cultural prominence of the International Congress, the organizers have
taken further steps to secure international
patronage.
