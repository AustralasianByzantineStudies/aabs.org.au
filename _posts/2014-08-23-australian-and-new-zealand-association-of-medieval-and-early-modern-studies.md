10th Biennial Conference, The University of Queensland**, 14-18 July
2015**

Sponsored by the Faculty of Humanities and Social
Sciences, The University of Queensland

We invite proposals
for papers and panels for ANZAMEMS 2015.

This is an
open-themed conference in order to encourage the widest range of
participation in the academic disciplines of medieval and early modern
studies. We welcome individual papers and full panels on themes from
across the period 600 to 1800, that includes, but is in no way limited
to, the disciplines of history, literary studies, music, art history,
intellectual history, theology and religious studies, the history of
emotions, cultural studies, philosophy, science, political and
constitutional history, medicine, maritime studies, law, performance
studies, gender studies, and cultural heritage.

We
particularly encourage papers and panels from graduate students, early
career researchers, as well as honours students.

The deadline
for paper and panel submissions is **31 October 2014**. Early
submissions, however, are encouraged and will be processed
immediately.

Conference papers are no longer than 20 minutes
each in order to leave 10 minutes discussion time for each paper in any
session. Each session contains three papers, and the conference program
is arranged in parallel sessions spanning all 5 days of the conference.
Proposals for full panels, comprising three papers, centred on a theme,
as are individual paper submissions, are most welcome.

All
proposals should be sent to: <anzamems2015@uq.edu.au>.
