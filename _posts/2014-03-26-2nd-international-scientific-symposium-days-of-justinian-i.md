Special Thematic Strand for 2014: "Samuel's State
and Byzantium: History, Legend, Tradition, Heritage"

The
International scientific symposium "Days of Justinian I" is an annual
interdisciplinary scholarly forum aimed at the presentation of the
latest research followed by discussions on various aspects of Byzantine
and Medieval Studies, that include the treatment and interpretation of
cultural, historical and spiritual heritage in contemporary Europe. The
Symposium is dedicated to Emperor Justinian I with the aim to address a
broad range of issues related to Byzantium and the European Middle Ages,
comprising the exploration of the cultural and historical legacy as an
integrative component of the diversities and commonalities of Unified
Europe.

This year the International Symposium "Days of
Justinian I" chose a special thematic strand "Samuel's State and
Byzantium: History, Legend, Tradition, and Heritage". Namely, the year
2014 commemorates the millennium of the legendary conflict between
Emperor Basil II and Tsar Samuel over the Balkans that ended with the
tragic death of Samuel in October 1014, after the defeat at the battle
of Belasica. The conflict itself is an illustrative example of how the
legends and myths were created and constructed, both in Medieval and
Modern times, incorporating many aspects of historical and cultural
tradition and heritage. The specificity of this conflict is its enduring
impact on the Medieval and Modern Balkans, consequently indicating the
need to present a more thorough and broader picture in order to
understand the contested interpretation and different perspectives and
to offer a clearer picture of how the medieval past was used in modern
history, politics and culture. The legendary conflict between Basil II
and Samuel is a universal phenomenon, thus embracing broader discussions
and geographical areas in exploring various aspects of religion,
ideology, identity, heritage, political and cultural memory and
myth-making reflected in the historical and cultural
legacy.

Papers are welcomed on various topics that may
include, but are not limited to, the following areas of
discussion:


-   Basil II versus Samuel: Real or imaginary conflict over the Balkans?
-   The Legend of Basil II and Samuel and the "Macedonian question"
-   Interpreting the legends in medieval and modern Europe
-   (De)Constructing the narratives and myths in medieval and modern
    Europe
-   Continuity and discontinuity in political ideology between medieval
    Bulgaria and Samuel's state
-   Ethnicity and identity in the Middle Ages: Defining the "others" in
    Europe
-   Popular religion, "native" churches, and medieval heresy
-   The Ohrid Archbishopric and religious tradition: medieval and modern
    perceptions of religion and ideology
-   The representation of Byzantium in art, literature, music and
    material culture: medieval and modern concepts and approaches
-   Byzantine and the Middle Ages in European history and culture:
    Bridging the East and West
-   Preserving the cultural heritage: Interpretation, restoration and
