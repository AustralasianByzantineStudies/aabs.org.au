University of Cyprus, **16-18 October 2014**

INTERNATIONAL
CONFERENCE

Tales of miracle and wonder decorate both ancient
and Byzantine literature and seem
to have had a great impact upon
ancient and Byzantine thought. A strong interest in
the wondrous is
already apparent in the works of Homer and Hesiod. However, a
more
organized recording of marvels is detected much later, in Herodotus's
time,
when marvelous stories and travel accounts of exotic places
and peoples are
increasingly produced. From the era of Alexander
and onwards such stories are
recruited by historians and rhetors in
an attempt to apotheose the ideal ruler. Between
the third century
BC and the third century AD, the genre of
paradoxography,
collections of stories relating strange events and
phenomena, achieves great
popularity, and influences another new
genre, the Hellenistic novel. At about the same
time, a number of
stories circulate that relate the miraculous healings of
suffering
people who practice incubation in Asclepian temples.
Later the practice of incubation
is taken over by Christian
pilgrims who are cured by saints. Miraculous healings and
other
types of miracles that are associated with a particular Christian shrine
become
the material of a new genre, the miracle collection which is
cultivated throughout the
Byzantine era. Miracle stories are
included in all Byzantine hagiographical genres,
since they
constitute the strongest sign of holiness. Miracles and wonders are
also
found in profane Byzantine genres, such as chronicles and
romances. Despite the fact
that marvel literature enjoyed such a
high popularity in antiquity and Byzantium, it
has been mostly
dismissed by modern scholars as debased, boring and
even
unintelligible, an attitude that has condemned this literature
to obscurity.
The conference's main aims are to bring to light
miracle and wonder literature and to
open up new avenues of
approach. Topics of exploration may include:


-   Literary Theoretical Approaches
-   Cultural Studies
-   Psychological Approaches
-   Comparative Literary Studies
-   Linguistics


Specialists are invited to submit a thirty-minute paper in English
on a relevant topic.
Due to budgetary constraints, the organizers
cannot cover the speakers' travel and
hotel costs. There is no
registration fee for participation or attendance.
Prospective
speakers are asked to submit by **30 April 2014** a
title and a 400-word abstract to
Stavroula Constantinou
(<konstans@ucy.ac.cy>) and Maria
Gerolemou
(<mariagerolemou@live.de>).
