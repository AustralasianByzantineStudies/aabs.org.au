The
official blog and Facebook page of the International Network for
Byzantine Philosophy.  On the blog you will find short communications,
reflections and announcements of events and publications related to the
field of Byzantine Philosophy.

The Facebook page exists to
foster engagement between scholars and members of the public who have an
interest in Byzantine Philosophy, broadly conceived.  Here we will post
news, events and resources related to the field and invite respectful
feedback and collaboration.

The initiative for the
International Network for Byzantine Philosophy has arisen from the
increasing body of published texts and studies in Byzantine philosophy.
It is only in the last twenty years or so that we have seen growth in
this field of Byzantine studies following the pioneering work of Basil
Tatakis (1896-1996) and Linos Benakis (b. 1928-). More recent work has
taken the subject forward by defining what is meant by 'Byzantine
philosophy', rather than 'philosophy in Byzantium'. Study of the subject
remained problematic because few took the Byzantines seriously, often
because it was thought there was no one who stood comparison with the
great medieval figures of the Latin west or the Islamic east. Thankfully
such comparisons are no longer made with scholars prepared to discuss
Byzantine philosophy as a topic its own right. However, much work awaits
the editing of Byzantine philosophical texts as well as the reception
history of those texts, both in Byzantium itself and by other
cultures.

The recently published Cambridge Intellectual
History of Byzantium, edited by Anthony Kaldellis and Niketas
Siniossoglou (2017), has further helped to bring the topic to the fore.
This volume has been voted the best Single Volume Reference in the
Humanities and Social Sciences of 2018 by the American Publishers
Awards. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy has an entry on
Byzantine philosophy, but more are needed on individual authors, such as
John of Damascus, Michael Psellos, Eustratius of Nicaea, Michael of
Ephesus, and Gemistos Plethon. Yet there is still some way to go before
standard reference works of philosophy include a section on Byzantine
philosophy. The International Network for Byzantine Philosophy will help
promote the subject area and encourage scholars to contribute news and
events. It seems this is an opportune moment to establish the Network so
that ideas and information can be exchanged and new work and research
publicised.
