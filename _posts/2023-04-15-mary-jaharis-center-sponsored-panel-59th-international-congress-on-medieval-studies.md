To encourage the integration of Byzantine studies within the scholarly
community and medieval studies in particular, the Mary Jaharis Center
for Byzantine Art and Culture seeks proposals for a Mary Jaharis Center
sponsored session at the 59th International Congress on Medieval
Studies, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, **May 9--11, 2024**. We
invite session proposals on any topic relevant to Byzantine
studies.

Session proposals must be submitted through the Mary
Jaharis Center website. The deadline for submission is May 15,
2023.

If the proposed session is approved, the Mary Jaharis
Center will reimburse a maximum of 4 session participants (presenters
and moderator) up to $800 maximum for scholars traveling from North
America and up to $1400 maximum for those traveling from outside North
America. Funding is through reimbursement only; advance funding cannot
be provided. Eligible expenses include conference registration,
transportation, and food and lodging. Receipts are required for
reimbursement. Participants must participate in the conference in-person
to receive funding. The Mary Jaharis Center regrets that it cannot
reimburse participants who have last-minute cancellations and are unable
to attend the conference.
