We are delighted to announce a 2-day conference, organized by the
National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in collaboration with the
Australian Research Council and Macquarie University,
Australia

The conference will take place at the University of
Athens, **8-9 June 2020**.

We have collaborated with the ISNS
conference organisers so to facilitate the participation of local and
international delegates to both events, but please note that the two
events are run independently. News about our conference can be found on

Our
Approach:

Taking start from our common interest in the
Platonic tradition and its reception in later periods, our collaboration
has to date yielded one edited volume (The Neoplatonists and their
Heirs, Brill, 2020, ed. Ken Parry and E. Anagnostou-Laoutides), while a
second one is anticipated to host select papers from the conference. We
now wish to expand our network of co-thinkers and thus, we welcome
papers on any aspect of Platonic reception, both in the Byzantine East
and the Latin West, in philosophical, literary and/or theological texts.
Confirmed Speakers include (in alphabetical order):

-Prof
Dirk Baltzly (University of Tasmania)

-Prof Kevin Corrigan
(Emory University)

-Prof Lloyd Gerson (Toronto
University)

-Prof Ilaria Ramelli (Durham University/
"Angelicum" University/ Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,
Milan)

Please send abstracts of circa 300 words to the
conference organisers by **15 December 2019**. Accepted speakers will be
notified by 15th January 2020.
