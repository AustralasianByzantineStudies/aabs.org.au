   PhD Colloquium on Late Antiquity
date: 2017-11-03

University of Reading, **4-5 May 2018**

Keynote speech: Dr.
Chiara O. Tommasi (University of Pisa): Esotericism in Classical and
Late Antiquity

Late Antiquity was once regarded as an age of
decadence and barbarisation as well as a 'marginal' field of study.
Those days are over. Late Antiquity has now its own  place in academia
and is considered a hot topic by both Classicists and historians of the
Early Middle Ages, as well as scholars of religious studies,
archaeology, art and philosophy in a fruitful exchange among
disciplines.

The study of Late Antiquity involves a wide
variety of disciplines. Our PhD Colloquium on Late Antiquity will take
place at the University of Reading in May 4-5, 2018. The aim of our
Colloquium is to make the most of such diversification by bringing
together  and achieving synergy among PhD Students from across the UK
and abroad working on Late Antiquity.

Each paper (15 min)
will be followed by a personalised response from a senior scholar (10
min) assigned by the organisers and a plenary discussion. Each delegate
will circulate  his or her paper a week in advance to his or her
respondent.

Additionally, we will also host a poster session,
with a £50 voucher prize for the best poster.

Lastly, the
Colloquium will include a visit to the Ure Museum of Classical
Archaeology of the University of Reading.

limited to) Greek and Latin Literature, History, Archaeology, Art,
Philosophy and Theology:
