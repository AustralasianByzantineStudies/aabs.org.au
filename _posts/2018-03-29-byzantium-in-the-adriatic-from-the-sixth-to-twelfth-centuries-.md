Byzantine Studies & Department of History, Faculty of Humanities and
Social Sciences of the University of Split

The field of
Byzantine Studies has recently gained impetus in Croatia from the
establishment of the Croatian Society for Byzantine Studies, which
aspires to become a cross-disciplinary research hub for experts in
manifold disciplines related to Byzantine Studies not only in Croatia
but in the region as well. Following the auspicious first steps of
bringing Byzantine Studies into the focus of Croatian academia and the
research community, the Croatian Society for Byzantine Studies now aims
to attract internationally acclaimed researchers of diverse disciplinary
backgrounds to a forum that will offer an opportunity to discuss a
plethora of research topics and questions bearing on the presence of
Byzantium in the Adriatic, and specifically to analyze the profile,
genesis and transformation of the region in response to the Byzantine
world system. The aim is to present and examine old as well as fresh
ideas in an innovative way to provide a more complete and in-depth
picture of the political, socio-economic, religious, legal, cultural
aspects of Byzantine influence, both direct and indirect, detectable in
the Adriatic, and particularly the eastern Adriatic coastal area, with a
chronological span from the Age of Justinian I to the final
disappearance of all vestiges of Byzantine authority and political sway
in the region in the twelfth century.

It is with great
pleasure that we invite you to participate in an international
conference 'Byzantium In The Adriatic From The Sixth To Twelfth
Centuries', organized by the Croatian Society for Byzantine Studies in
close cooperation with the Department of History, Faculty of Humanities
and Social Sciences of the University of Split. The conference will take
place on September 28-30 in Split, to coincide with the opening of the
exhibition *Byzantium on the East Adriatic* at the Museum of Croatian
Archaeological Monuments in Split.

The conference's special
thematic strands include, but are not limited to, the following
topics:


-   defining 'Byzantium' and its influence in the Adriatic context
-   (dis)continuity of the Byzantine presence in the Adriatic region
-   Adriobyzantinism, Latin Byzantinism, Slavic Byzantinism
-   overlapping zones of influences: problems of centre, periphery and
    province
-   comparative studies: Ravenna, Pentapolis, Roman Duchy, Venice,
    Istria, Greece, Sicily, Sardinia, Apulia, Calabria, Benevento,
    Marche, etc.
-   Byzantium's influence on the ethnogeneses in the Adriatic coastal
    area
-   transmission of texts
-   conversion, Christianization and the Church (the interference of
    jurisdictional and liturgical influences from Constantinople, Rome,
    Aquileia/Grado; the network of bishoprics; the Cyrillo-Methodian
    Mission)
-   Byzantine legal traditions
-   Byzantine traditions in diplomatics, language, anthroponymy,
    toponymy, hagiography
-   Byzantine traditions in social structures (urban elites,
    aristocracy, family and society)
-   manifestations of Byzantine authority: public institutions,
    administrative structures, circulation of Byzantine money, seals
-   Byzantine cultural circles in the Adriatic (Justinianic Age,
    Macedonian dynasty, etc.)
-   settlements, towns, urban history, spatial organization
-   material culture with Byzantine characteristics and provenance in
    the Adriatic (archaeology, cemeteries, jewellery, weapons, tools,
    costumes)
-   the so-called Byzantine *limes marittimus* in the Adriatic (forts,
    *castra*, defence systems)


The conference encourages a broad interdisciplinary approach open
to specialists and researchers of various profiles: historians,
archaeologists, art historians, liturgists, epigraphists, linguists,
classical philologists, etc.
