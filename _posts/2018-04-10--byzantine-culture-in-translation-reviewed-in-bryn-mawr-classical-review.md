This collection of
essays presents translation as a phenomenon crossing disciplinary
boundaries. To quote Amelia Brown's introduction, "Byzantium was a
culture of constant translation. Within the empire, individuals from the
emperor and the patriarch of Constantinople down to the people of the
imperial capital, other cities and the countryside, engaged in
translating the texts, structures and concepts of their Roman imperial
past into a meaningful context for their present" (p. 1). The twelve
essays range through time and geographical focus from fifth-century
Italy and North Africa through seventeenth-century Wallachia and the
poetry of Yeats. Each essay concludes with an extensive bibliography of
primary and secondary sources, and all are informed by meticulous use of
evidence and careful argumentation; texts cited in their original
language include English translations. Seldom can an essay be
categorized within a single discipline such as philology, social
history, folklore, Quellenforschung, or material culture because the
authors explore their subject matter for its significance in a range of
medieval and modern contexts.

Google Books provides a useful
sample of this volume. Readers will find a full table of contents
(authors and titles are also listed at the end of this review), a brief
prefatory paragraph identifying the 2014 Conference of the Australian
Association for Byzantine Studies as the origin of this volume, and a
list of contributors with their affiliations. The text of Amelia Brown's
introduction follows (pp. 1-7) with a brief informative summary of each
contribution. Google Books closes its sample with the first 16 pages of
Roger Scott's essay on Byzantine chronicles from Malalas to Kedrenos,
enabling readers to gain a sense of the tone and quality of the volume
as a whole.

Since Amelia Brown's introduction makes the
description of individual articles unnecessary here, I shall focus upon
material gleaned from various essays that I particularly appreciated as
a philologist who has worked on texts through the early Palaiologan era.
In this enterprise, I do not in any sense mean to dismiss other essays
nor to diminish their interest for readers. What follows is a series of
points that I found particularly striking from my own disciplinary
perspective.

Byzantine authors considered their own Greek
literary inheritance as comprehensive and beyond improvement; as a
result, Byzantine culture generally ignored the Latin literary component
of their legacy from the Roman imperial past (i.e., Livy, Vergil,
Tacitus). Accordingly, indications of Latin texts available in
Constantinople and of readers able to use them are valuable. In Chapter
1 ("Narrating the Reign of Constantine in Byzantine Chronicles"), Roger
Scott establishes that the historical Constantine held little interest
for the early Byzantine chroniclers, who concentrated upon erasing any
hint of Arianism from his early associations as described by Eusebius
and substituted an orthodox account of his baptism by Pope Sylvester.
Malalas may have used a Syriac tradition for this account and influenced
Theophanes the Confessor in the ninth century as well. It was George the
Monk in the late ninth century who introduced evidence from the Latin
Vita Sylvestri, using the archives of the Patriarchate in Constantinople
(p. 14), and Kedrenos in the eleventh century who thoroughly exploited
the Latin text by consulting a copy directly (pp. 19-23). Although it is
known that the Byzantine imperial chancery employed Latin translators
during this period to conduct business with western rulers and
delegations, little is known about the holdings of the Patriarchal
library and the linguistic competence of its users.

John
Burke offers a new and stimulating interpretation of a frequently
discussed epigram (or epitaph?) in Chapter 5, "Nikephoros Phokas as
Superhero." Eight modern editions of the text have appeared and two
tenth-century dates suggested. After a careful examination of the
historical context of internal references, Burke rejects the epigram as
a part of a pro-Phokas tenth-century dossier and joins previous scholars
in dismissing the suggestion that it was inscribed on the imperial tomb.
On the basis of his own examination of the two twelfth-century witnesses
to the text, Burke offers a sensitive interpretation of two voices
created by the poet, one a first-person singular in a sober tone of
tragic irony, the second a first-person plural at an emotional pitch of
excessively pious melodrama that is typical of the tenth-century
akolouthia for Phokas. Nothing in the diction of the poem requires
attributing it to John Geometres, as some scholars have done; instead,
Burke follows the manuscripts and accepts the alternative attribution to
the learned Metropolitan John of Melitene (second half of the eleventh
century). In Burke's view, John satirized the excessive piety of the
second, cultic voice in the epigram and typifies the attitude of the
contemporary ecclesiastical hierarchy, "No new saints!" The closure of
the canon of saints has recently been the focus of scholarly interest
and discussion. In Chapter 6 ("Byzantine Religious Tales in Latin
Translation: The Work of John of Amalfi"), John Duffy locates this
bilingual western monk at the monastery of Zoodochos Pege in
Constantinople in the late eleventh century, where members of the
Amalfian trading community encouraged his work as a rare foreign
extension of a popular Latin genre. John's Liber de miraculis contains
42 'edifying tales' for Greek monastic use compiled from various sources
as well as additional unpublished saintly narratives (pp. 115-17). John
followed the recommendations of Leo of Amalfi in his translator's
preface, adopting a mixture of close adherence to the original text and
the 'sensum de sensu' method to produce a readable Latin text accessible
to most readers because it resembled ecclesiastical Latin of the sixth
to seventh centuries. Duffy characterizes the register of John's
translation through his vocabulary, drawn from the contemporary language
used in southern Italy, some words from transliterated Greek terms and
others formed from Latin elements equivalent to Greek (p. 123). John's
residence in Constantinople as a western monk, his association with
traders there, and his ability to attune his Latin style to a
contemporary southern Italian audience are notable features of his role
in this rare literary exchange at a popular level from the orthodox East
to the Latin West.

Maria Mavroudi delivered the keynote
address at the Conference, "Translations from Greek into Latin and
Arabic during the Middle Ages: Searching for the Classical Tradition," a
revised version of her seminal article originally published in Speculum
90/1 (2015, 28-59) and reprinted here as Chapter 7. Mavroudi stresses
adaptation as a constant theme across medieval societies. Christian
Byzantium adapted classical Greek literature to meet practical and
cultural needs by forming collections and devising commentaries; the
Arabic- and Latin-speaking worlds selected and translated ancient Greek
texts significant for their changing circumstances; Byzantine Greek
astronomical and medical texts of the seventh- ninth centuries were
translated into Syriac, Arabic, Slavic, or Latin. In every case the
particular needs of a society determined translation activity. Two
chapters in particular enlarge upon the theme set forth by
Mavroudi.

In Chapter 4 ("Bang for His Buck: Dioscorides as a
Gift of the Tenth-Century Byzantine Court"), Yvette Hunt explores the
'diplomacy of the book' (p. 90) implied in a quotation from the Arab
historian Ibn Juljul:

Romanos, Emperor of Constantinople,
sent him [al-Nasir 'Abd al- Rahman III] a message---I think it was in
the year AD 948 [337 AM]---and presented him with gifts of great
value, including the book of Dioscorides, with pictures of herbs in the
marvelous Byzantine style and written in the Greek language ... Romanos
wrote in his letter to al-Nasir: 'Dioscorides' book cannot be utilized
except with the help of a person who knows Greek well and is acquainted
with the drugs concerned. If there is someone in your country equipped
with the necessary knowledge, you will, O king, derive great profit from
this book ...' (p. 73, italics mine)

Hunt demonstrates the
political importance of this gift made to the Umayyad court at Cordoba
as an assertion that the Byzantines, not the Arabs or Persians, were the
true guardians of the ancient Greek medical tradition and that Byzantium
possessed resources superior to the translations made at the Abbasid
court of Baghdad (p. 90). As a useful complement to Hunt's article, note
Anne McCabe's essay on the importance of pharmacology in trade. She
discusses the gift and the context for ibn Juljul's questionable
identification of the book's donor as the nine-year-old Romanos II,
Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos' son and co-Emperor; she also
identifies ibn Juljul as a member of the team commissioned at Cordoba to
translate the text with the assistance of Nicholas, a qualified Greek
requested from Constantinople by the caliph (p. 287).1 Readers of Hunt's
essay will enjoy quotations demonstrating Persian and Arab scorn for
Byzantium as a repository of ancient Greek science. For example, Hunt
cites a late tenth-century Arabic anecdote describing a vast ancient
pagan temple kept secret and locked behind huge iron gates "since the
time that the Byzantines had become Christians" and containing
inscriptions, sculptures, and "numerous camel loads of ancient books"
(p. 78).

In Chapter 8 ("A Web of Translations: Planudes in
Search of Human Reason"), Eva Anagnostou-Laoutides demonstrates
convincingly that thirteenth-century Byzantine ecclesiastical politics
fostered Planoudes' translations and commentaries on Boethius and
Augustine as adaptations to serve the union of eastern and western
Churches, a project pressed by the Emperor Michael VIII. Orthodox
theology and the writings of these two Latin authors converged in
relying upon Plato and Aristotle as interpreted by the Neoplatonist
Plotinos. Anagnostou-Laoutides identifies Plotinos as the source of
Boethius' Aristotelian theory of the soul and also of Augustine's
Trinitarian theology; she demonstrates through Planoudes' vocabulary
choices in his annotated translations of De consolatione philosophiae
and De trinitate that Byzantine readers would recognize in these Greek
versions echoes of Plotinos, Plato, and Aristotle. Modern readers may
wish to explore further the surprising vagaries of Palaiologan adoption
and adaptation of Augustine by consulting two essays not cited by
Anagnostou-Laoutides: Elizabeth Fisher, "Planoudes' De Trinitate, the
Art of Translation, and the Beholder's Share," and Reinhard Flogaus,
"Inspiration---Exploration---Distortion: The Use of Augustine in the
Hesychast Controversy."2

Bronwen Neil's "Conclusion:
Translating Byzantium in the New Millenium," indicates a stimulating way
forward for Byzantine Studies in an international climate of waning
public interest in the humanities and diminished funding opportunities
for scholars. Basing her discussion upon the successful cooperative
initiatives of Australian Byzantinists, she notes that historical
studies must adapt emphasis and methodology to government funding
criteria for a "perceived national benefit" (p. 258) such as a current
project examining parallels in the revisionist strategies used by
Christians, Jews, and pagans in the fifth-seventh centuries;
similarities to the rewriting of history and destruction of monuments in
the modern Middle East are striking. Translations and commentaries on
previously scorned 'popular' literary genres open new questions and
perspectives. New technologies have also brought the opportunity for
on-line language teaching, electronic publications, and the wide
availability of valuable on-line data bases. International collaborators
can now exchange materials rapidly and accurately though electronic
communication. "As we seek to broaden Byzantine horizons," she
concludes, "we stand to gain a whole new audience. The cultural
translators studied within this volume would surely sympathise with such
a goal" (p. 264).
