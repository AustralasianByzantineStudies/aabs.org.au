**7--10 October 2016**, Plovdiv, Bulgaria

The National
Archaeological Institute with Museum at the Bulgarian Academy of
Sciences, in partnership with the Ephorate of Antiquities of Rhodope
(Greece) and Istanbul University, has the pleasure of inviting you to an
international conference specially dedicated to Roman and Late Antique
Thrace (RaLATh). The event will be appropriately hosted in the very
heart of the region -- Plovdiv, the descendant of ancient
Philippopolis.

The conference theme focuses on the cities of
Thrace, their territories and the expressions of local identity in Roman
and Late Antique times. We aim to bring together archaeologists,
historians, numismatists, epigraphists, art historians, and scholars
from any related fields, for an interdisciplinary approach to the study
of the region. Contributors are invited to discuss all aspects of urban
life in Roman and Late Antique Thrace. Relevant areas of research
include, but are not limited to: settlement patterns, civic space
planning, architecture, city economy, religion, festivals. Selected
proceedings of the conference will be published before the next edition
of the event in autumn 2017.
