Byzantium was one of the
longest-lasting empires in history. Throughout the millennium of its
existence, the empire showed its capability to change and develop under
very different historical circumstances. This remarkable resilience
would have been impossible to achieve without the formation of a lasting
imperial culture and a strong imperial ideological infrastructure.
Imperial culture and ideology required, among other things, to sort out
who was ʻinsiderʼ and who was ʻoutsiderʼ and develop ways to define and
describe ones neighbours and interact with them.

There is an
indefinite number of possibilities for the exploration of relationships
between Byzantium and its neighbours. The essays in this collection
focus on several interconnected clusters of topics and shared research
interests, such as the place of neighbours in the context of the empire
and imperial ideology, the transfer of knowledge with neighbours, the
Byzantine perception of their neighbours and the political relationship
and/or the conflict with neighbours.
