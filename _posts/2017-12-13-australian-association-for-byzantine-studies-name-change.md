The Australian Association for Byzantine Studies has changed its name to
the Australasian Association for Byzantine Studies.  The renamed
Australasian Association for Byzantine Studies retains its membership in
the International Association of Byzantine Studies (AIEB) as the
National Committee of Australia.  The Australasian Association for
Byzantine Studies admits members from New Zealand on the same terms as
members from Australia; all funds remain in Australian accounts
regardless of executive affiliations.
