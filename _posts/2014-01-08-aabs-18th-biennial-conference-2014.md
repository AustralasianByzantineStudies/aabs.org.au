This a preliminary announcement about the next [AABS
conference](http://www.aabs.org.au/conferences/18th/ "Byzantine Culture in Translation"),
which will be held at the University of Queensland from 28-30 November
2014. Details will be posted on this web site and circulated by email as
they become available.

Byzantine culture emanated from
Constantinople throughout the Middle Ages, eastwards into Muslim lands
and central Asia, north into Russian, Germanic and Scandinavian
territories, south across the Mediterranean into Egypt and North Africa
and westwards to Italy, Sicily and the other remnants of the western
Roman empire. Byzantine culture was translated, transported and
transmitted into all these areas through slow or sudden processes of
permeation, osmosis and interaction throughout the life of the Empire,
from the fourth century to the fifteenth and far beyond. Various
literary aspects of Byzantine culture that were literally translated
from Greek into the local and scholarly languages of the Medieval West
and Muslim Middle East include dreambooks, novels, medical and
scientific texts and works of Ancient Greek literature. Yet translation
was a phenomenon that stretched far beyond texts, into the areas of
clothing and fashion, the visual arts (especially icons) and
architecture, military organisations, imperial court ceremonial,
liturgical music and mechanical devices. This conference celebrates all
aspects of literary, spiritual or material culture that were transported
across the breadth of the Empire and exported from it. Papers are
welcome on all aspects of Byzantine culture that exerted some
influence - whether lasting or fleeting - and were translated into
non-Greek-speaking lands, from the early Byzantine period to the present
day.
