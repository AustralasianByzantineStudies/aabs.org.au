February 2022 Zoom Conference - **18-20 February** in the East; **17-19
February** in the West.

"Persistence and Resistance: 100 to
1000 CE"

The Pacific Partnership in Late Antiquity (PPLA)
plans to have a conference on
Zoom in February 2022 on the topic of
persistence and resistance in late
antiquity, defined here
capaciously as running from 100 to 1000 CE.

The theme is
broad and we encourage creativity in its
interpretation.
Presentations could treat texts of all kinds, from
poetry to law codes to
epigraphy and beyond; the built environment;
textiles; reception in late
antiquity or of late antiquity; the
resistance to and persistence of
institutions, pathogens, genres,
antiquity, iconographies, icons, etc.

We welcome scholars at
all levels (graduate student to professor) to propose
presentations
of one of two kinds:

20-minute paper (the usual sort of
conference paper)

5-minute lightning talk (presenting an
exciting idea, sharing some thoughts on
a problem, etc.) Each of
these will have 5 minutes of discussion afterwards.
(If possible,
we will have session of general questions after a panel
of
these.)

The plan is to have around three hours of
sessions at a sensible time each day
over three
days.
