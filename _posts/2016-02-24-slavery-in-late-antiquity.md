XXIV Finnish Symposium on Late Antiquity, Tvärminne, Finland, **11--12
November 2016**

The multidisciplinary Finnish Symposium on
Late Antiquity will be organized on 11--12 November 2016. The symposium
brings together scholars and postgraduate students of Late Antiquity
from a variety of universities and academic disciplines.

The
theme of this year's symposium is Slavery in Late Antiquity. Research on
slavery in the late Roman Empire and in the post-Roman kingdoms has been
expanding and evolving in the recent decades. The theme will be
approached from a wide perspective, including social, economic,
political, legal, ideological and religious levels. We welcome papers
that discuss slavery from the point of view of landowning, local
differences, changes in rural and urban settings, alterations in ideas
and attitudes, and modifications in status and everyday life. Papers
that analyse scholarly approaches to late antique slavery are also
welcome.

Please send a short abstract of 250--300 words along
with your name, institution, e-mail and title by **2nd May 2016** to Dr.
Ville Vuolanto:
