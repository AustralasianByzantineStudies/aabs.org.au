title:  Ritualizing the City: Collective Performances as Aspects of Urban Construction
date: 2015-02-25
---

Brno, Czech Republic, **3-4 March, 2016**

Organizer: Ivan
Foletti, Masaryk University in Brno and University of Lausanne -- Centre
for Cross-Disciplinary Research into Cultural Phenomena in Central
European History: Image, Communication, Behaviour.

The
conference aims to reflect on the ways in which collective liturgies--
religious as well as civic and totalitarian -- contributed to the
construction of urbanism from late Antiquity to theÂ  twentieth century
and, on the other hand, how urban topography and the layout of the city
influenced collective performances. The goal of such a reflection is to
indicate how a collective ritual performance grows and develops in
dialogue with the surrounding urban space. But especially how it
participates in the determination of that same space.

The
purpose of the conference is thus to explore the dialectic relationship
between the city and collective rituals, beginning with Late Antique
Rome, marked out by stationary liturgy, through medieval and modern
cities designed to celebrate sovereigns and bishops, up to Stalinist
Moscow, constructed to embrace the manifestations of Soviet
power.

Participants are invited to reflect on such issues as:
the methods used by the rituals to integrate the space of the cities; in
what way collective performances are modified and adjusted to a specific
urban situation; the manner in which urban space is reconstructed and
modified to facilitate collective performances; how, with a change of
regime, the new collective liturgies adapted themselves to the new
situation. Papers presenting a historiographical and diachronic art
historical and methodological perspective are especially
welcomed.

Paper proposals of no more than one page,
accompanied by a short CV, can be submitted until **10 September** 2015
