The State Hermitage museum is happy to announce Call for Papers for two

Traditions* (**September 28-29 2017**) and *Byzantium Within the Context
of the World Culture* dedicated to the memory of Alisa V. Bank
(**October 2-4 2017**).

The *Christian Orient* conference
topics include the wide range of problems concerning Eastern Christian
contacts with other religious groups and traditions, focusing basically
on discussing written sources.

*Byzantium Within the Context

aspects of Byzantine cultural heritage.

You can choose any of
these conferences or participate in both of them.

The
deadline for submitting proposals to the conferences is **June 1
2017**.
