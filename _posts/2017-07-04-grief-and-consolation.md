Grief, particularly the grief associated
with bereavement, has been a constant companion of humanity throughout
the ages. But how are we best to deal with grief? Traditional rituals
have had a part to play, but consolation for grief has also been sought
through intellectual processes: through awareness and (self-) analysis
of the emotional and cognitive responses to grief, and through the
articulation of grief in language, music and the arts.

Held
under the joint aegis of the Institute of Advanced Studies UWA, the
Discipline of Classics and Ancient History at UWA, and the ARC Centre of
Excellence for the History of the Emotions, this interdisciplinary
colloquium proposes a broad exploration of grief, and of the strategies
employed in the consolation grief across time and culture. Papers (of c.
20 minutes' duration) are invited to engage with this theme, whether
literary, musical, philosophical, medical or other
perspectives.

The special guest at the colloquium will be
Professor Han Baltussen, the Walter Watson Hughes Professor Classics at
the University of Adelaide. Professor Baltussen will be visiting UWA in
September as an IAS Visiting Professor; while in Perth, he will be
working on his current project, which traces the emergence of the
conscious treatment of grief in ancient Greek oratory, philosophy and
medicine.
