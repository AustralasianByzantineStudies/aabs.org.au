architecture and science, between
Greek, Latin, Arabic and other languages.  These
chapters build
upon presentations given at the 18th Biennial Conference of the
Australian
Association for Byzantine Studies, convened by the
editors at the University of
Queensland in Brisbane, Australia on
28-30 November 2014.
