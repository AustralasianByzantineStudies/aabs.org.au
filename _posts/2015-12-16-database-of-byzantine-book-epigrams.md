The
*Database of Byzantine Book Epigrams* (*DBBE*) is freely accessible.
Hosted by Ghent University, this database seeks to collect all book
epigrams (or metrical paratexts) found in Greek manuscripts up to
1500.

The corpus can be searched for a specific epigram or
browsed by a number of parameters such as date and type of manuscript.
The information provided is based on catalogues, scholarly publications
as well as consultation of manuscripts. The *DBBE* will be of use for
classicists and Byzantinists, literary scholars, linguists,
palaeographers, art historians and anyone generally interested in
medieval manuscript culture.
