Details

The time is ripe to place
environmental issues at the heart of debates about Late Antiquity.
Recently, a paper on the climate change during the age of Justinian,
published in Nature, received coverage in all major American and
European newspapers. This article is not an isolated case, yet
mainstream late antique scholarship has not so far absorbed this
work.

This conference will be a decisive step in making the
late antique community aware of a whole range of environmental phenomena
that affected Mediterranean and northern European societies at the end
of Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. We will adopt a
Mediterranean-wide approach and look at the period of Late Antiquity
from a broader chronological perspective, that of the 1st millennium
A.D. This time frame is critical to interpreting climate and vegetation
data, which are most meaningful in a long-term context.

The
conference itself has two aims. Firstly, it will present the rich pollen
and scientific data available for the study of the first millennium AD
in different regions. Secondly, it will develop and reinforce the
environmental perspective on Late Antiquity. The focus on the whole
Mediterranean (with its hinterland in Northern Europe) will correct a
bias towards the East seen in recent studies on the environmental
history of Late Antiquity. The conference will interest not only
scholars of the 4th to 7th c., but also early medievalists and students
of earlier Graeco-Roman Antiquity.
