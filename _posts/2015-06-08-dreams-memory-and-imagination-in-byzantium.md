Australian Association for Byzantine Studies 19th Conference, **24-26
February 2017**, [Monash University, Melbourne](http://www.monash.edu/)


In the last two decades, the role of dreams, memory and the
imagination in the ancient world and its cultural productions have come
to receive increased attention, along with the importance of emotions in
the Greco-Roman and medieval worlds. This conference will focus on the
ways that the Byzantine imagination shaped its dreams and memories from
the fourth to fifteenth centuries and the many ways in which these were
recorded in the Byzantine world, in its historiography, literature,
religion, art and architecture.

Professor Derek Krueger of
Greensboro University, North Carolina, will be our guest speaker at this
international conference.

We welcome papers on any aspect of
the topic, including reception studies. The call for papers will be
issued in July 2016. Two student bursaries will be offered to HDR
students who present papers.

Further information will be
available on this web site or from the Convenor, Dr Eva
Anagnostou-Laoutides, at <eva.anagnostoulaoutides@monash.edu>, or for
general enquiries <conference@aabs.org.au>.
