**About
the Mary Jaharis Center for Byzantine Art and
Culture**

Founded in 2010 through a generous gift from the
Jaharis Family Foundation, the Mary Jaharis Center for Byzantine Art and
Culture is dedicated to the promotion and advancement of knowledge about
the rich heritage of Byzantine art and culture. The Mary Jaharis
Center's location on the Hellenic College Holy Cross campus provides a
unique opportunity to foster Byzantine studies within an Orthodox
Christian community. The Center sponsors a wide range of public
programming and supports the study of Byzantium through grants and other
resources.
