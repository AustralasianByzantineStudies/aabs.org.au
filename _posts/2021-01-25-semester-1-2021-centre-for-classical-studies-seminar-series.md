Call for Presenters

The ANU Centre for
Classical Studies invites submissions for the Semester 1 2021 public
seminar series (Late February to mid-May). Speakers are invited to
present on any topic related to Classical Studies and Ancient History,
broadly defined to include late antiquity and early Byzantine
Studies.

Due to COVID-19 seminars will be presented via Zoom.
As a matter of policy seminars will not be recorded. Seminars typically
meet at 1:00 PM Sydney/Canberra time. Exceptions can be made on a case
by case basis, especially for overseas presenters who are especially
encouraged to apply.

The standard seminar format is 60
minutes, including 40 minutes for presentation and up to 20 minutes for
Q&A. Since seminars are followed by the ANU Honours seminar, time limits
will be strictly observed.

Perspective presenters should
submit a title and brief abstract (no more than 250 words) by email by
COB on 15 February 2021.

Questions and submissions can be
directed to Dr. Ryan Strickler, Lecturer in Classics, at
<ryan.strickler@anu.edu.au>.
