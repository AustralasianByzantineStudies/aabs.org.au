XVIIITH Biennial
Conference, 28-30 November 2014, University of
Queensland

Byzantine culture emanated from Constantinople
throughout the Middle Ages, eastwards into Muslim lands and central
Asia, north into Russian, Germanic and Scandinavian territories, south
across the Mediterranean into Egypt and North Africa and westwards to
Italy, Sicily and the other remnants of the western Roman empire.
Byzantine culture was translated, transported and transmitted into all
these areas through slow or sudden processes of permeation, osmosis and
interaction throughout the life of the Empire, from the fourth century
to the fifteenth and far beyond. Various literary aspects of Byzantine
culture that were literally translated from Greek into the local and
scholarly languages of the Medieval West and Muslim Middle East include
dreambooks, novels, medical and scientific texts and works of Ancient
Greek literature. Yet translation was a phenomenon that stretched far
beyond texts, into the areas of clothing and fashion, the visual arts
(especially icons) and architecture, military organisations, imperial
court ceremonial, liturgical music and mechanical devices. This
conference celebrates all aspects of literary, spiritual or material
culture that were transported across the breadth of the Empire and
exported from it. Papers are welcome on all aspects of Byzantine culture
that exerted some influence - whether lasting or fleeting - and were
translated into non-Greek-speaking lands, from the early Byzantine
period to the present day.
