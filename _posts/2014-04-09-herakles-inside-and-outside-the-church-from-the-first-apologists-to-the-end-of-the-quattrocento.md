title: Herakles Inside and Outside the Church: From the First Apologists to the End of the Quattrocento
date: 2014-04-09

An International, Interdisciplinary Conference to be held at the
University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand, **23-26 June
2015**.

The study of the reception of classical figures into
Christianity is a recently renewed scholarly trend which overcomes
decades of isolation between classicists and medievalists, while drawing
attention to an often overlooked fact: the early Christian masses were
none other than the recently converted, dissatisfied pagan citizens of
the faltering Roman Empire. In those early days, Christian theologians
zealously took up the task of debating and defining the self-projections
of their flocks against the backdrop of pagan outrage typically embodied
by the Roman emperors. However, in addressing their followers, early
Christian theologians could not ignore the wealth of classical
literature and philosophy as points of reference, recognizable by their
audiences and powerful enough to warrant modification. Indeed, the
majority of early Christian writers were themselves products of the
pagan educational system and hence, well versed in pagan traditions.
Their handling of Heracles, the most quintessential pagan hero known for
his strength, his twelve labours, and his civilizing efforts as well as
for his quick temper, lust and frenzied violence, the hero idealized by
emperors such as Nero, Commodus and Maximian, is indicative of the
urgency to reform pagan models in the Christian context, but, also, of
the affinities between pagan and early Christian intellectual debates.
Centuries later, while the Church was proclaiming the death of paganism,
it was continuing to appropriate many pagan gods and heroes, including
Heracles, into its service.

Our conference seeks papers on
any aspect of the adoption/adaptation of Heracles from Late Antiquity to
the end of the Quattrocento, including the use of his image in Christian
and non-Christian context, and the use of his mythology in Christian and
non-Christian literature (poetry, prose, didactic, polemic, libretti,
etc.). Panel proposals would be welcome.

For individual
papers please send an abstract of 300 words with tentative title by
**June 15 2014** to both Arlene Allan (<arlene.allan@otago.ac.nz>) and
Evangelina Anagnostou-Laoutides
(<eva.anagnostoulaoutides@monash.edu>).

For panels proposals
we would request that the panel leader first collect the 300-word
abstracts and then submit them as a groupÂ with a proposed panel name to
the above email addresses by **30 June 2014**.
