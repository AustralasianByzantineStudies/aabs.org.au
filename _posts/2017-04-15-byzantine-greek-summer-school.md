**Byzantine Studies Research Center**




Bogazici University, Istanbul




**June 28- July 21, 2017**


The Byzantine Studies Research Center is pleased to announce the
organization of its first Byzantine Greek Summer School program to be
held at Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey, from June 28 to July 21,
2017. Students will have the chance to participate in an intensive
program in Medieval Greek with Prof. Niels Gaul, while enjoying various
attractions of the Bogazici University campus on the Bosphorus and the
Byzantine sites of Istanbul.

**Format**

The course
is designed for students who have completed at least two semesters of
college-level Classical Greek or its equivalent. Students are expected
to have knowledge of basic Greek grammar and to be able to read simple
texts from ancient Greek or Byzantine literature. The morning sessions,
devoted to the reading of Byzantine texts from various genres, will be
supplemented by private tutorials in the afternoon. Each student will
have one hour of tutorial per week. The language of instruction is
English. The program will offer tours in the weekends to the important
Byzantine sites and museums in Istanbul. Students will receive a
certificate of participation upon successful completion of the
program.

**Instructor**

Niels Gaul is the A. G.
Leventis Professor of Byzantine Studies at the University of Edinburgh.
He is the author of *Thomas Magistros und die spätbyzantinische
Byzantinistik* (2011) and the co-editor, with S. Steckel and M.
Grünbart, of *Networks of Learning: Perspectives on Scholars in
Byzantine East and Latin West, c. 1000--1200* (2014) and, with Av.
Cameron, of *Dialogues and Debates from Late Antiquity to Late
Byzantium* (2017). From August 2017 he will be the Principal
Investigator of an ERC-funded project, "Classicising learning in
medieval imperial systems: cross-cultural approaches to Byzantine
*paideia* and Tang/Song Xue'."

**Location**

The
classes will be held at the Byzantine Studies Research Center at
Bogazici University.  Bogazici University, established as Robert College
in 1863, is one of the leading institutions of higher education in
