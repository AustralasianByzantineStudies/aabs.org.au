2019 Conference of the Australian Early Medieval
Association

**3--5 October 2019**  Monash University,
Clayton, Australia

This conference invites papers on the
broad theme of legitimacy.  In a modern world dominated by deeply
polemical counter narratives not afraid to adjust facts to claim
dominance and, thereby, legitimacy, we look at the ways in which modern
forms of the pursuit of legitimacy evolved in the early Middle Ages. 
Legitimacy can have several meanings, covering aspects of authenticity,
legality, validity and conformity.  While it literally refers to
something that meets the requirements of the law, this legal aspect is
not inherent: something can be legitimate without being legal, or be
legal without being legitimate.

In the context of the early
medieval period, who legitimated?  What were their reasons for doing
so?  Conversely, what was set aside in the process of illegitimisation? 
And what do these dominant and counter narratives mean for the
presentation of history?  Legitimacy implies dominant views on
authority, cultural legitimacy, status and control of the means to
ensure dominance, such as publication.  It can create hidden communities
and counter-narratives.  Even though the early medieval period continues
to exist in the popular imagination as backward and insular, in many
ways it is a period marked by innovations in both the practice and
pursuit of legitimacy, innovations which still resonate to this day.
This conference aims to challenge the perception that the modern world
is particularly modern in the way it contests legitimacy.
