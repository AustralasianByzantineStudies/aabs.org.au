Australian Early Medieval Association Conference, **1-2
October 2021**.

The conference committee invites papers on
the theme of *Eruption/Disruption/Interruption*. As we continue to
process the impact of COVID-19 on global and local societies, the jury
is still out on whether the eruption of a global pandemic, and the
subsequent disruptions and interruptions to contemporary routines, are a
'game-changer' or an inconvenience.

At the heart of our
theme is the concept of a **rupture**. This can refer to something that
has broken, burst, or been destroyed. It can imply that either outside
forces are too great for the structure in question and have destroyed it
functionally, or that something within that which has ruptured was too
volatile or incompatible to remain contained, controlled, or unified.
Over the past 18 months, we have been witness to both of these types of
rupture, as outside forces have challenged the very foundations of our
society, while at the same time, internal tensions have broken forth and
resulted in historic movements for democracy, equality, environmental
awareness, and corporate accountability and
transparency.

Global society is at a turning point of
multiple ruptured points, and the 2021 AEMA conference aims to reflect
on this tension in an early medieval context.


-   Eruptions can be understood in many different ways, as they can
    describe both natural phenomena and human activity, including the
    sudden appearance of new movements, of groups of people, or of
    ideas.
-   Were eruptions revolutionary? Or were they merely a disruption to
    the *longue dur√©e*?
-   Does hindsight make it easier to identify ruptures as epoch-altering
    events and ideas? Or does the passage of time, and attendant loss of
    witnesses, memories, and evidence muddy the waters too much?
-   Why and in what ways did eruptions change things? And why and in
    what ways did they merely disrupt.
-   When and how does an interruption become a disruption?
-   What did the idea of a 'new normal' mean in the early medieval
    world? How quickly do societies adapt to internal and external
    pressures?
-   And when societies change as a result of these pressures, are they
    still the same society?


This conference calls for papers that relate to this theme. Or, in
the spirit of the theme, those that do not.

In 2021, AEMA intends to hold a **hybrid conference**, with
both a physical location (or locations) as well as an online option. At
this stage, the main physical location is likely to be in Victoria, with
the potential for additional 'hubs' to be held in other Australian
and/or International locations, depending on interest and
availability.

Submissions may be in the form of individual
papers of 20 minutes duration, themed panels of three 20-minute papers,
or Round Tables of up to six shorter papers (total of one
hour).

All sessions will include time for questions and
general discussion. Please send proposals (150--200 words per paper),
along with author's name, paper/panel/RT title, and academic affiliation
(if any) to
[conference@aema.net.au](mailto:conference@aema.net.au) by **31
July 2021**. Please also direct all other enquiries about the conference
to this address, as well as any nominations for potentially hosting an
in-person hub.
