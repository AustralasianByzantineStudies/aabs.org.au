2017 Conference of the Australian Early Medieval Association, Australian
National University, Canberra, **21-22 April
2017**

[Conference
Website](http://www.aema.net.au/conference.html)

In
1979 Hans-Robert Jauss published *The Alterity and Modernity of Medieval
Literature*, an essay which defined reception theory and invited us to
rediscover in the alterity of the Middle Ages an aspect of its
modernity.  For students of the Early Middle Ages, a field defined from
its naissance by an emphasis on inter-disciplinary research, Reception
theory can offer a surprisingly rich return.  The 12th conference of the
Australian Early Medieval Association takes Reception as its theme.  We
will be investigating the ways in which the literature, history,
language and culture of the ancient world were received into
post-Classical Europe; the ways in which the literature, history,
language and culture of the Middle Ages have been received into the
modern world; and the ways in which the Medieval world acted as conduit
for the transmission of the Classical. This allows a very wide scope for
papers of course, but, as always, we will still be welcoming any papers
related to the studies of the Early Middle Ages even if they do not
strictly adhere to the theme.

Abstracts of 250-300 words for
20-minute papers should be submitted via email to
[conference@aema.net.au](mailto:conference@aema.net.au)
by **20 February, 2017**.
