Society of Classical Studies 154th Annual Meeting, **5-8
January 2023**, New Orleans

Call for Papers for
Panel Sponsored by the Society for Late Antiquity: Slow and Fast
Violence in Late Antiquity

Organized by Henry Gruber,
Department of History, Harvard University

We invite papers
that address violence --- of all types --- in the long Late
Antiquity.

The period now known as Late Antiquity was
originally defined by catastrophic military violence: Hordes of
barbarians poured across the Roman frontiers, burning fields, plundering
cities, and leaving destruction in their wake. In recent decades,
catastrophist views of the period 250-750 CE have receded in scholarly
discourses, replaced by a narrative that foregrounds transformation,
accomodation, and cultural intermingling. While there have been some
notable and controversial attempts (Ward-Perkins, *The Fall of Rome*,
2005) to recenter military violence as a primary --- and destructive ---
historical agent in Late Antiquity, for the most part this latter
approach seems to dominate.

Although military violence has
receded from the foreground of late antique studies, violence has not.
Rather, broader and more nuanced understandings of violence shape our
understanding of the period (Drake, ed., *Violence in Late Antiquity,*
2016). Major recent works have focused on religious violence within and
between faith communities (Gaddis, *There is No Crime for Those Who
Have* Christ, 2005; Sizgorich, *Violence and Belief in Late Antiquity*,
2009; Shaw, *Sacred Violence*, 2011; Kalleres, *City of Demons,* 2015);
violence as a source of and form of social control (Cooper and Wood,
*Social Control in Late Antiquity,* 2020), and the related violence of
enslavement (Harper, *Slavery in the Late Roman World*, 2011; Rio,
*Slavery After Rome*, 2017).

Many of these new types of
violence can be understood to exemplify Slow Violence, a concept
pioneered by Humanities and the Environment scholar Rob Nixon (*Slow
Violence,* 2011) to encompass the ways in which violence---especially
against the poor---can occur in ways that are not as immediately visible
as the fast violence of military conflict. This slow violence, which
feminist critics (Christian and Dowler, "Slow and Fast Violence: A
Feminist Critique," 2019) have also pointed out is often gendered
feminine, shapes and structures contemporary society through pollution,
workplace exploitation, and other long tendrils of the global supply
chain. We hope to show how interrogating slow violence, as opposed to
violence as necessarily fast and presumably military, reopens the
question of the violence in Late Antiquity by expanding its definition
to include the everyday violence of social domination in the city and
the countryside.

In this session, we will ask about types of
violence --- fast and slow --- in Late Antiquity. We welcome papers on
religious violence, spiritual violence, and visions of violence; fast
military violence like battles, sacks, and sieges, as well as the slow
violence of recruitment, requisition, and taxation; enslavement and
slavery; sexual violence and sexual labor, inside and outside of
enslavement; judicial violence such as prisons and the slow violence of
the Roman penal state; the mines; the gladiators; gender based
violences; and the often-hidden role of women as both victims and
purveyors of violence, which include domination and enslavement in the
domestic sphere, sexual exploitation, and the violence inherent in Late
Antique high politics.

Papers may last no longer than twenty
minutes, and will be followed by five minutes for discussion. The
session will conclude with an extended period of discussion between
panelists and audience members. Please send questions and abstracts of
no longer than 500 words by email to Henry Gruber (Harvard University)
at <hgruber@g.harvard.edu> **by the extended deadline of 15 February
2022**. Abstracts should be sent as an email attachment; please make
sure they are anonymous. All submissions will be judged anonymously by
two referees. Prospective panelists must be members in good standing of
the SCS at the time of submission and must include their membership
number in the cover letter accompanying their abstract. Please follow
the guidelines for individual abstracts (see the SCS [Guidelines for
Authors of
Abstracts](https://classicalstudies.org/annual-meeting/guidelines-authors-abstracts)).
Acceptance decisions will be communicated to the authors of abstracts by
April 1, 2022, with enough time that those whose abstracts are not
chosen can participate in the individual abstract submission process for
the upcoming SCS meeting.

Submitting an abstract represents a
commitment to attend the 2023 meeting if the paper is accepted. No
papers will be read in absentia, and the Society for Late Antiquity is
unable to provide funding for travel to New Orleans.
