To encourage the integration of Byzantine studies within the scholarly
community and medieval studies in particular, the Mary Jaharis Center
for Byzantine Art and Culture seeks proposals for a Mary Jaharis Center
sponsored session at the 2023 International Medieval Congress,
University of Leeds, **July 3--6, 2023**. We invite session proposals on
any topic relevant to Byzantine studies.

The thematic strand
for the 2023 IMC is "Networks and Entanglements." See the IMC Call for
Papers
([https://www.imc.leeds.ac.uk/imc-2023/](https://www.imc.leeds.ac.uk/imc-2023/))
for additional information about the theme and suggested areas of
discussion.

Session proposals must be submitted through the
Mary Jaharis Center web site
([https://maryjahariscenter.org/sponsored-sessions/imc-2023](https://maryjahariscenter.org/sponsored-sessions/imc-2023)).
**The deadline for submission is September 6, 2022.** Proposals should
include title, 100-word session abstract, session moderator and academic
affiliation, information about the three papers to be presented in the
session, for each paper: name of presenter and academic affiliation,
proposed paper title, and 100-word abstract, and organizer's
CV

The session organizer may act as the moderator or present
a paper. Participants may only present papers in one
session.

Applicants will be contacted by mid-September about
the status of their proposal.

If the proposed session is
approved, the Mary Jaharis Center will reimburse a maximum of 4 session
participants (presenters and moderator) up to $800 maximum for European
