We are pleased to invite abstract submissions for AMPHORAE VIII, the
Eighth 'Annual Meeting of Postgraduates in Hellenic or Roman
Antiquities and Egyptology', to be held at the University of Melbourne
from **Wednesday 26 to Friday 28 November 2014**. The conference is
designed to provide an opportunity for postgraduate students from
Australia and New Zealand, and internationally, to interact with their
peers and share their work in a friendly and stimulating environment.
The keynote address will be delivered by Professor Hans Beck of McGill
University. Professor Beck has also offered to run a Masterclass for
attendees.

This year's theme is **Emerging Horizons:
Material Culture, Text & Thought** and is intended to accommodate
research from (but not limited to) all of the fields of Classical
Philology, Classical Art and Literature, Ancient History, Archaeology,
Late Antiquity and all other areas of the Ancient World. Abstracts
addressing any interpretation of the conference theme are welcome. As in
previous years, ASCS will be providing a number of bursaries for
students travelling to the conference.

Abstract submissions
of 100-200 words for papers of 20 minutes' duration, as well as a brief
biography, should be submitted by 9pm AEST on **Tuesday 30 September**
to
[amphoraeviii@gmail.com](mailto:amphoraeviii@gmail.com).
Offers of poster presentations will also be welcomed, especially from
Honours students. If you would like to attend the conference, but do not
wish to present a paper, simply submit a registration form informing us
of your attendance by the same date. Please note also that the
Australasian Women in Ancient World Studies (AWAWS) will be hosting a
special panel this year. If you would like to be considered, or
contribute to this panel, please contact AWAWS directly at
