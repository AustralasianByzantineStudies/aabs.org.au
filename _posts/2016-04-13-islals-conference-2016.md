title: ISLALS Conference 2016
date: 2016-04-13
---

The fourth annual conference of the International Society for Late
Antique Literary Studies (ISLALS) will convene on the campuses of Bryn
Mawr College and Haverford College on October **21--22, 2016**. The
organizers for this year's conference, in despair of capturing under a
single rubric all the exciting new work being done in late antique
literary studies, issue an open call for all papers on late antique
literature *qua *literature. Close analyses of a single textual moment
in poetry or prose; sweeping surveys of author, genre, image, or trope;
precise detective work on a long nettlesome crux; and paradigm-shifting
theoretical diatribe are all encouraged.

If you would like to
participate, please send a brief abstract of your paper via email
attachment to Bret Mulligan
([bmulliga@haverford.edu](mailto:bmulliga@haverford.edu){target="_blank"})
by **June 15, 2016**. Papers should run no longer than thirty minutes.
Also welcome are abstracts for shorter papers and proposals for other
forms of scholarly presentations (panels, lightning talks, posters,
etc.).

ISLALS requires no dues and there is no registration
fee for the conference. ISLALS will provide transportation,
refreshments, breakfast and lunch during the conference. A closing
banquet for all conference participants will round out this year's
gathering. Expenses for lodging and travel to and from the conference
will be the responsibility of participants. The organizers will help
participants secure lodging on campus (limited) or at nearby
hotels.

Bryn Mawr College and Haverford College are located
ten miles from downtown Philadelphia. Additional information about the
conference can be found at
