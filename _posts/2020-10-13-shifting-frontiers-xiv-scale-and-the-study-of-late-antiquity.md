title: Shifting Frontiers XIV: Scale and the Study of Late Antiquity
date: 2020-10-13
---

**3-5 June 2021**, The Ohio State University, Columbus,
OH.

This event will take place virtually via
Zoom.

For the Fourteenth Meeting of the Society for Late
Antiquity, we invite papers that investigate scale, which can be defined
as a graduated range of values or measurements, whether, for example, of
time, space, social organization, cosmology, or agency. Participants are
encouraged to explore scale either as a methodological framework used by
modern historians to interpret the past and/or as a type of late Roman
analytic category, developed and employed by late ancient persons for
their own heuristic purposes. Questions papers might ask include: To
what extent does the world of Late Antiquity look different if we
approach its events, institutions, and processes (whether political,
economic, social, or religious) from a micro scale rather than a macro
scale, and vice versa? How can we better understand the late Roman
Empire through the examination of macro- and micro-scalar environmental
phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions and mutating plague DNA, which
were only partially (if at all) perceptible to the late Romans
themselves? Alternatively, what graduated categories of measurement and
values did late ancient thinkers deploy in their philosophical,
scientific (including astrological), and religious works to make sense
of metaphysical, ethical, or even physical quandaries? And what did
scale mean to individuals on an everyday level, for agriculturalists or
merchants whose livelihoods were embedded within multi-scalar economic,
environmental, legal, social, and religious networks? Other papers might
consider the fractal replication of structures and relationships across
the Empire, for example in conciliar operations (Senate, local curia,
church councils), patterns of deference across the social scale, or in
the provincial extensions of imperial authority. Comparativists are
encouraged to consider how problems of scale inflect transhistorical
arguments that encompass both late antiquity and other periods of
history.

**Special Directions for Virtual
Format**

The program committee recognizes that online
conferencing opens opportunities for scholarly presentations and
discussions that deviate from the traditional model of "present a paper
and then take questions." The past few months have been a time of
experimentation for all of us. Rather than define (and thereby limit)
those alternative modes in advance, we encourage you to propose them to
us, and so our task will be to decide not only which papers will be
included, but which formats too. Options include thematically linked
papers that are posted before the conference so that attendees can read
them before their authors hold a panel discussion at the conference; or
scholars who wish to pre-post textual, visual, video, or audio material
and then take only five minutes to present their argument, leaving more
time for discussion. Each submission will still need to have a regular
abstract, but please indicate whether you would like to experiment with
an alternative mode of presentation.
