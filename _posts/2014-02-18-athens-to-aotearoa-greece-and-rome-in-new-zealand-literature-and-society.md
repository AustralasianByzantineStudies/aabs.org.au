Victoria University of Wellington (New Zealand), **4-6 September
2014**

The Classics Programme at Victoria University of
Wellington is delighted to announce a conference on the reception of
antiquity in New Zealand, to take place in Wellington on 4-6 September
2014. This conference seeks to explore New Zealand's relationship with
its Greco-Roman heritage both through a critical appraisal of its
effects but also by glimpsing into the creative experiences of New
Zealand's writers and artists. To that end, we solicit presentations
from students of antiquity as well as New Zealand culture and society,
and from New Zealand writers, artists, and performers who have engaged
with texts, themes and ideas from antiquity. Our common goal will be the
elucidation of New Zealand's distinctive appropriation of the
classics.

We will announce our keynote speaker and circulate
a full CFP soon. In the meantime, for further information please do not
hesitate to contact Simon Perris: <simon.perris@vuw.ac.nz>.
