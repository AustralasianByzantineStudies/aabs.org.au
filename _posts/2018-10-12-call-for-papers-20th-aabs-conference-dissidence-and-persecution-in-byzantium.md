**CALL FOR PAPERS**

The Byzantine empire
was rarely a stable and harmonious state during its long and eventful
history.  It was often in strife with those outside its borders and with
those within them, and with so much power invested in its political and
ecclesiastical structures it was ready to implode at times.  This could
result in persecution and the silencing of dissident voices from various
quarters of society.  The mechanisms by which the authorities controlled
civil disorder and dissent, as well as discouraging criticism of
imperial policies, could be brutal at times.  In what sense was it
possible, if at all, to enjoy freedom of speech and action in
Byzantium?  Was the law upheld or ignored when vested interests were at
stake?  How vulnerable did minorities feel and how conformist was
religious belief at the end of the day?  The theme of the conference
aims to encourage discussion on a number fronts relating to the use and
abuse of power within the history of Byzantium.  Individual papers of 20
mins or panels (3 papers) will be accepted on the following or related
themes:


-   The rhetoric of persecution in hagiography and historiography
-   Monastic dissidence and dissidents
-   The persecution of minorities
-   Dissension in the military
-   Imperial usurpation and sedition
-   Discourses of violence and tyranny in literature
-   Popular uprisings and civil disobedience
-   Satire and literary subversion
-   Laws relating to prosecution and capital punishment
-   Depictions of persecution in Byzantine art
-   Slavery and manumission
-   The forced baptism of Jews and others
-   Heresy and the imposition of religious orthodoxy
-   The suppression and oppression of women
-   Persecution of philosophers and other intellectuals
