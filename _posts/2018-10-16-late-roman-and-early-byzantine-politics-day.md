Following on from the success of last year's inaugural

Wednesday November 28^th^ 2018 a second event will be held on this
theme.  This is an informal work-in-progress day, offering the
opportunity for scholars in Sydney and beyond working on the politics of
this period to meet, share papers on their research and exchange
ideas.

Papers of up to 25 minutes are invited by academics
and advanced graduate students on the topic of late Roman and early
Byzantine politics (c. 300-600AD).

Please send prospective
titles and a short abstract of up to 100 words
to [meaghan.mcevoy@mq.edu.au](mailto:meaghan.mcevoy@mq.edu.au){target="_blank"} **by
Friday October 26th**.

In order to fund the cost of catering
for the day, a registration fee of $20 (payable in cash on the day)
will be asked of all attendees. Receipts will be available for tax
purposes.

Space is limited, however, so please RSVP **by
Monday November 19^th ^**to confirm attendance, even if not giving a
paper.

Exact starting and finishing times will be determined
by the number of papers. All welcome!
