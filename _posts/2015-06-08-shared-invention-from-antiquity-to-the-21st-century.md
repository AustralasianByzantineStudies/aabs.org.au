Clermont-Ferrand, Aubusson and Limoges, **6--8 April
2016**

An international colloquium entitled 'Shared
Invention: From Antiquity to the 21st Century' will be held 6--8 April
2016, and proposals for papers are now being accepted. The colloquium is
being organized by Laurence Riviale and Jean-François Luneau, lecturers
at Blaise Pascal University, Clermont-Ferrand (France), in partnership
with Musée national Adrien Dubouché, Limoges (France) and Cité de la
Tapisserie, Aubusson (France). It will take place in Clermont-Ferrand,
Aubusson and Limoges. 'Shared invention', or collective creation, is the
chosen theme for this international colloquium, whose aim is to enable
art historians working in a range of fields to understand better
creation in the fine arts and production in the decorative
arts.

When an artist's work of art is translated into another
medium, if the craftsman is not himself the inventor, but only a docile
workman, how can differences in two items made by two craftsmen
according to the same design be accounted for, but by a margin of
liberty and sensitivity in which the very personality of the maker
expresses itself? This margin will be at the heart of the debate, taking
into account historical, social, and cultural contexts of all the
periods in question.

After the Middle Ages, during which
painters and sculptors belonged to a regular, legally instituted trade,
those whom we now denote 'artists' tried to distinguish themselves by
invention, leaving execution or transposition to craftsmen, and strove
to elevate their trades to the dignity of liberal arts. For Giorgio
Vasari, such a claim is satisfied by the expression 'arts of design',
which were to become the 'fine arts', that is, painting, architecture
and sculpture. 'Design' thereby has became the discriminating point for
all academies that were subsequently founded, from the Accademia delle
arti del disegno in Florence (1563) to the French Académie royale
(1648), and later on, the British Royal Academy (1768). Art historians
have seldom questioned this hierarchy and have more readily studied the
creations of a 'genius', leaving the craftsman's production in the
shadow.

But is invention only the privilege of the artist who
provides the design? Recent scholarly studies have striven to understand
the processes of creation at the heart of workshops through artistic
documentation, such as the miscellanies of modelli and inventories of
human positions collected by painters in the sixteenth century,
revealing the almost universal use of what has been called,
paradoxically, the 'invention copy' -- that is, the creation of a new
composition achieved by putting together heterodox bits from everywhere.
This type of process highlights the role of the patron, who may be the
true inventor, as he owns designs and ideas and is responsible for this
aspect of the composition from beginning to end. In this case, the
so-called 'artist' is but a kind of go-between, and can only be
understood as a mere workman.

Papers devoted to etchings or
engravings, stone masonry, wall-painting or paper, furnishing or fashion
fabrics, chinaware, stoneware, stained glass, etc., are welcome,
especially if they emphasize not only the margin of liberty mentioned
above, but also the aspects of works of art appropriate to their
destination and intended meaning. Summaries of 2500 or 3000 characters
will be submitted, along with a short CV (three lines), before **22 June
2015**, to <laurence.RIVIALE@univ-bpclermont.fr>, or
<laurence.riviale@orange.fr>, or <J-Francois.LUNEAU@univ-bpclermont.fr>.
Applicants will receive a reply in September 2015.
