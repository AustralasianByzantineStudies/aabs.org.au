Ritual practices
dedicated to maritime success appear across a wide span of human
cultural history, from the Mediterranean to the North Sea, Southeast
Asia across the Pacific to the west coast of the Americas.
Culturally-constructed seafaring rituals could be seen as spiritual or
superstitious, and respond to the combination of risk and profit endemic
in even short voyages by water. Maritime religion infuses all
water-borne contact across cultural boundaries; the crafts of those who
build rafts, canoes, and sailing vessels; navigational skills which may
reach back to ancestors who have faded into cultural legend; and myriad
mnemonic and naming strategies extending to littoral markers and
celestial patterns. Mythic and ritual responses are accordingly complex,
ranging from apotropaia to the divine authorization of civic structures,
shipboard shrines and functional epithets which could link divinities,
heroes and nearly-deified rulers to the control of the waves and
winds.

Studies of religion and maritime mobility are often
framed within individual cultural contexts, but this international
conference seeks to bring together scholars from across a range of
disciplines and historical periods, from prehistoric to the seventh
century CE, to address critical questions in method and theory relevant
to religion in the context of maritime mobility. Among these questions
