This
collection of studies on *Dreams, Memory and Imagination in Byzantium*
covers four main themes: the place of dreams, imagination and memory in
the Byzantine philosophical tradition; the political uses of prophetic
dreams and visions in imperial contexts; the appearance and manipulation
of dreams and memory in Byzantine poetry and histories, and changing
commemorations of the saints over time in art, epigraphy and
literature.  These studies reveal the distinctive and important roles of
memory, imagination and dreams in the Byzantine court, the
proto-Orthodox church and broader society from Constantinople to Syria
and beyond.  This volume of Byzantina Australiensia brings together the
work of senior and early career scholars from Australia, Greece, Israel,
Italy, Japan, New Zealand and the United States.
