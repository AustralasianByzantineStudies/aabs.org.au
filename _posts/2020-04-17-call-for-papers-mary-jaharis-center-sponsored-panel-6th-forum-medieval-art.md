The Mary Jaharis Center for Byzantine Art and Culture seeks proposals
for a Mary Jaharis Center sponsored session at the 6th Forum Medieval
Art, Kunstgeschichtlichen Instituts, Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,
**September 29--October 2, 2021**. The biannual colloquium is organized
by the Deutsche Verein für Kunstwissenschaft e.V.

The theme
for the 6th Forum Medieval Art is Senses. The arts and the senses have
always been reciprocally related to one another. In the Middle Ages,
sensual encounters with art and architecture offered a variety of ways
to perceive, comprehend and structure the world. Pledging to relics
enclosed in precious reliquaries, incorporating color from Byzantine
icons, distinguishing the holy space by swinging golden polished
censers, wearing inwardly decorated jewelry on the body or ringing the
church bells to make audible the presence of God -- such actions leave
no doubts about the significance of the senses in the Middle Ages, and
furthermore bring to light the role of art within such
operations.

Although the senses and their interplay are well
defined in theoretical treatises, theories are of limited use when it
comes to understanding the sensual perception of images, objects, and
spaces. While, for instance, the knowledge of God is described as a
dematerialized act, the senses were nevertheless used to obtain and
mediate spiritual insight. Since antiquity, seeing has been the dominant
sense, as the works of authors such as Aristotle, Plato, Augustine and
Isidore of Seville suggest. This privileged position was further
ascribed by cultural and art historical research over a long period of
time. Nevertheless, in recent years, studies on materiality have argued
that the dominance of this one singular sense misrepresents the
multisensory nature of medieval art. The 'close-up' senses such as
tasting and touching are as essential for the understanding of artefacts
as the 'distant' senses of seeing, hearing and smelling. In particular,
liturgical and courtly ceremonies offer convincing evidence that
processes of production and reception are related to multisensory
experiences. The role of the senses in the architecture and decoration
of sacred space has been revaluated not only within Latin Europe and the
Byzantine Empire, but also within Islamic dominated regions.
Furthermore, in order to comprehend the codex, one of the leading media
throughout the Middle Ages, questions of sensual perception through
tasting and sometimes kissing of its different elements such as
parchment and paper, as well as textiles, leather, metal and ivory have
also proved to be essential.

For the 6th Forum Kunst des
Mittelalters, the organizers anticipate discussions on the role of
sensual perception and the interplay of senses in medieval image and
object cultures as well as in architecture, including topics from
interreligious and cross-cultural perspectives. Studies on individual
senses and the ways in which they played, guided, deceived and disturbed
sensual perception are welcome, as well as proposals which privilege a
multisensory and synesthetic approach. Proposals that discuss the
methodological challenges that arise from these perspectives are
encouraged. Furthermore, which possibilities do digital methods offer
for understanding historical contexts of perception, e.g. through
virtual reality or the reconstruction of auditive and oratorical spaces?
This includes studies on the increasing popularity of multimedia
concepts in exhibitions that question how the historicity of sensual
approaches could be represented and, beyond that, how it could help to
reveal new interpretative frameworks.

The Mary Jaharis Center
