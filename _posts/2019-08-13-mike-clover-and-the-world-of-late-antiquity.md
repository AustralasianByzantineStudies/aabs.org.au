Leeds International Medieval Conference, **6-9 July
2020**.

Sponsored by the Mike Clover Memorial
Consortium.

Following the untimely death of Mike Clover, a
much beloved and admired scholar of Late Antiquity in general and the
Vandals in particular, his students, colleagues, and friends are
proposing a series of conference sessions in his honor for the Leeds
International Medieval Conference, 6-9 July 2020. Given Mike's
interests, the theme for next year's conference, "Borders," makes this
initiative even more appropriate. We would welcome submissions on the
kinds of topics that Mike liked to work on, things like
barbarians/Vandals, prosopography, the Historia augusta, Ammianus,
hagiography, coinage, and late Roman history in
general.

Submissions can be sent to Ralph Mathisen,
<ralphwm@illinois.edu>. The deadline for submissions in **September
21**. Subsequently, the wheels at the IMC will grind slow but fine, and
the IMC states, "we anticipate being able to notify paper/session
proposers whether their proposal has been accepted into the programme by
the December prior to the IMC."
