November, 2019**

Confirmed keynote speaker: Professor Anthony

Organised by Institute of National History, Skopje,
Ss. Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje and University of Bologna, in
partnership withFaculty of Theology St. Clement of Ohrid, Skopje, with
the financial support of the Ministry of Culture and the City of
Skopje

The International scientific symposium "Days of
Justinian I" is an annual interdisciplinary scholarly forum aimed at
the presentation of the latest research followed by discussions on
various aspects of Byzantine and Medieval Studies before 1500; this
includes the treatment and interpretation of cultural, historical and
spiritual heritage in contemporary modern Europe. The Symposium is
dedicated to Emperor Justinian I with the aim to bring together scholars
from around the world to address a broad range of issues related to
Byzantium and the European Middle Ages, comprising the exploration of
the cultural and historical legacy as an integrative component of the
diversities and commonalities of Unified Europe.

This year's
special thematic strand Identities aims to incite scholarly debate about
the differing perceptions of identity in Byzantium and in Medieval
Western Europe. Aside from the discursive evidence in the contemporary
sources, modern theoretical approaches will be addressed in exploring
the complex concepts and notions of identity, covering the broad range
of modes of identification. Various fundamental questions will be raised
in defining how identities were formed in the Middle Ages and how they
were expressed, maintained, negotiated or transformed. This will
encompass the ways in which Byzantium and other pre-modern states and
empires have shaped and configured the composite spectrum of political,
ethnic, provincial, legal, religious or cultural
identities.

The symposium will embrace broader geographical
areas, chronological scope, and varieties of political, ideological,
cultural, social or religious contexts in exploring the multiple layers
of identity in the Eastern Roman Empire and in Medieval Western
Europe.

include, but are not limited to the following areas of discussion:


-   Romanness in the Middle Ages: Concepts and approaches
