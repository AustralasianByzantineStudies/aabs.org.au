The Byzantine Studies Research Center at Boğaziçi University is pleased
to announce the online conference "Mobility and Materiality in
Byzantine-Islamic Relations (7th-12th Centuries)" to take place on
**12-13 November 2021**.

This international conference brings
together scholars who are interested in exploring mobility as well as
the question of how mobility manifests itself in materiality between
Byzantine and Islamic communities from the seventh century to 1204.
Seventeen papers to be presented at the conference address political,
economic, and religious/cultural networks facilitating the movement of
people and objects, the role of mobility in the organization and
sustenance of groups and individuals, the nature of the contacts on the
land and sea frontiers, and the impact of materiality on the processes
of transfer, use/consumption, appropriation, and identity building in
the context of Byzantine-Islamic relations.
