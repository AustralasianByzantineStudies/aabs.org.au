To encourage the integration of Byzantine studies within the
scholarly community and medieval studies in particular, the Mary Jaharis
Center for Byzantine Art and Culture seeks proposals for a Mary Jaharis
Center sponsored session at the 54th International Congress on Medieval
Studies, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, **May 9--12, 2019**. We
invite session proposals on any topic relevant to Byzantine
studies.

Session proposals must be submitted through the
[Mary Jaharis Center

The deadline for submission is **May 27, 2018**. Proposals should
include:
**Title
**Session abstract (300
words)

notified by May 30, 2018, if their proposal has been selected for
submission to the International Medieval Congress. The Mary Jaharis
Center will submit the session proposal to the Congress and will keep
the potential organizer informed about the status of the

The session organizer may act as the presider or
present a paper. The session organizer will be responsible for writing
the Call for Papers. The CFP must be approved by the Mary Jaharis
