Papers are being sought for two panels on Late Antique Italy to be held
at the 52nd International Congress on Medieval Studies, Kalamazoo on
**May 11-14 2017**. These panels are sponsored by the Central European
University (CEU).

In 2007, the Central European University
held a summer program entitled *The Birth of Medieval Europe:
Interactions of Power Zones and their Cultures in Late Antique and Early
Medieval Italy* at which an international and interdisciplinary
collection of scholars and graduate students convened to discuss and
debate the issues associated with the 'Fall of Rome' and its aftermath.
Focusing on the relationships between different centres of power,
authority, and culture in Late Antique Italy, *The Birth of Medieval
Europe* considered new ways of thinking about late Roman imperial
administration, the economy, the 'barbarian' invasions and the arrival
of new ethnic groups into Italy, the nature and evolution of ethnicity
and ethnic identity, and ultimately the 'fall' of the Roman Empire.
These were contentious subjects then, and remain so
today.

Organized to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the
original CEU program, these two sessions will examine new developments
in the field and reassess the conclusions of the original 2007 program.
More specifically, the organizers invite contributions that (re)consider
the relationship between different centres of power, authority, and
culture, in Late Antique Italy. These include but are not limited to the
cities of Ravenna and Rome, the Roman Church and secular power, the
Roman Empire in Italy and its relationship with the East/the Provinces,
and the Ostrogothic, Lombard, and ultimately Carolingian successor
kingdoms established in Italy. Following the plan of the original
program, contributions are welcome from scholars studying ancient and
medieval history, Italian studies, Byzantine history, Mediterranean
history, archaeology, and church history.

If you wish to
participate, please submit a paper title, a short abstract (no more than
~250 words) and a CV to the organizers at
