The Mary Jaharis Center for Byzantine Art and Culture is pleased to
announce its 2019-2020 grant competition. Our grants reflect the Mary
Jaharis Center's commitment to fostering the field of Byzantine studies
through the support of graduate students and early career researchers
and faculty.

Mary Jaharis Center Dissertation Grants are
awarded to advanced graduate students working on Ph.D. dissertations in
the field of Byzantine studies broadly conceived. These grants are meant
to help defray the costs of research-related expenses, e.g., travel,
photography/digital images, microfilm.

Mary Jaharis Center
Publication Grants support book-length publications or major articles in
the field of Byzantine studies broadly conceived. Grants are aimed at
early career academics. Preference will be given to postdocs and
assistant professors, though applications from non-tenure track faculty
and associate and full professors will be considered. We encourage the
submission of first-book projects.

The application deadline
for all grants is **February 1, 2019**. For further information, please
