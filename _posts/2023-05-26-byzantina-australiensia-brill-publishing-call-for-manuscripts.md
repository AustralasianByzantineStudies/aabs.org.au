Byzantina Australiensia is a refereed academic series established by the
Australasian Society for Byzantine Studies in 1981 and is dedicated to
increasing knowledge of the eastern Roman world, its material and
literary cultures, its religious practices, its
sources or their reception. We have gained a reputation for publishing
excellent and accessible translations and editions of medieval Greek
texts with commentaries. We are particularly interested in new
approaches to the corpus that embrace recent theoretical developments in
Byzantine studies.

The series also welcomes conference
volumes focused on themes relevant to eastern Roman empire from the
fourth to fifteenth centuries. A new focus for the series is
high-quality monographs by early career researchers or established
scholars from any country. All relevant subjects in Byzantine Studies
that meet the criteria of the series will be 
considered.
