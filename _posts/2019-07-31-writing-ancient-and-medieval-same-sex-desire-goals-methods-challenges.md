This
call for papers is for a conference to take place June 30-July 2, 2020
at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, on the topic of
writing about same-sex desire in ancient and medieval
societies.

Derek Krueger (UNC Greensboro), Mark Masterson
(Victoria University of Wellington), Nancy Rabinowitz (Hamilton
College), and Shaun Tougher (Cardiff University) will be providing 
plenary addresses.

For several decades now, scholars have
devoted attention to same-sex desire in both ancient times and the
centuries that followed. Not surprisingly, there have been vigorous
debates over how to go about it. These debates have been framed in
various ways. Here are some examples:


-   essentialism VERSUS constructivism;
-   Foucauldian discourse analysis VERSUS approaches inspired by
    psychoanalysis;
-   (the impossibility of) objective history VERSUS (overly) subjective
    history;
-   perception of commonalities across time VERSUS rigorously
    historicizing insistence on the past's alterity;
-   positivism VERSUS imaginative reconstruction of contemporaneous
    receptions.


These dichotomies, which are both reductive and don't exhaust the
possibilities, continue to crackle with contention. They also continue
to undergird and even disturb current scholarly
endeavours.

We are looking for papers (30 minutes in length)
in which scholars not only speak about primary source material but also
reflect explicitly on the theoretical orientation of their work (see the
dichotomies above for examples) and the purpose(s) of (their)
scholarship on same-sex desire. An additional objective of this
conference will be an edited volume of papers that will aim to showcase
a variety of approaches to this important topic.

Please send
proposals (c. 500 words) to Mark Masterson
(<writingsamesexdesire@gmail.com>) by **1 December 2019**. If you have
any questions, please send them to him at this address
also.

In your proposal include
1)      the primary
source material/historical milieu to be discussed, and
2)      the
general theoretical basis of the work.

This conference is
underwritten by the Marsden Fund/Te Pūtea Rangahau A Marsden of the
Royal Society/Te Apārangi of New Zealand.
