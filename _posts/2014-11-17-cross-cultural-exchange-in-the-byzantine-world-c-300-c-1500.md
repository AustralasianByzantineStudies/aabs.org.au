title: Cross-Cultural Exchange in the Byzantine World, c. 300-c. 1500
date: 2014-11-17
---

The Oxford University Byzantine Society's XVII International Graduate
Conference, **27--28 February 2015**, University of
Oxford.

Byzantium, in all its forms, was an influential
society, drawing many different peoples into its sphere. This influence,
however, was neither one-way nor topdown. Cultures from beyond the
borders of the Empire also impacted on life within it. Interaction and
exchange between cultures was both direct and indirect, spanning from
Scandinavia, Latin Europe, Africa and into the Islamic world and the
Eurasian steppe. Learning, not exclusively classical knowledge, passed
not only from culture to culture but from generation to generation;
migration and settlement as well as trade and direct conflict all
brought different communities into contact throughout the Mediterranean
and beyond. What followed could include the translation of literature,
the mimesis of art and architecture and religious conversions, as well
as the practical adoption of customs, clothing and foods. The Roman
Empire, its continuator in the Eastern Mediterranean and all the
successor states were deeply involved in all manner of cross-cultural
exchanges throughout their existences.

We are calling for
papers which explore all possible approaches towards these issues, in
all fields of Late Antique and Byzantine studies and beyond, including
history, archaeology, history of art, theology, literature, intellectual
history, and philology. Possible themes might include:


-   The inheritance of classical wisdom
-   Diplomatic exchanges and customs
-   Translations from Latin, Slavonic, Syriac, Arabic, Persian,
    Armenian, Hebrew, Latin and western vernaculars into Greek and vice
    versa
-   Transaction of medical and technological knowledge
-   Travel accounts
-   Religious debates and conversions
-   Military developments
-   Relations with nomadic peoples
-   Trade and the movements of material culture
-   Art and artists across borders
-   Prosopography


Please send an abstract of no more than 250 words, along with a
short academic biography in the third person, to the Oxford University
Byzantine Society at <byzantine.society@gmail.com> by **Friday, 28
November 2014**. Papers should be 20 minutes in length, and may be
delivered in English or French.

As with our previous two
conferences, there will be a publication of selected ontheme and
inter-related papers, chosen and reviewed by specialist readers from the
University of Oxford's Late Antique and Byzantine Studies department.
Any speakers wishing to have their papers considered for publication
should try to be as on-theme as possible in their abstract and paper.
Nevertheless, all submissions are warmly invited.

More
details will be sent to successful submissions soon after the deadline.
Subject to funding, the OUBS hopes to offer subsidised accommodation for
visiting
speakers.
