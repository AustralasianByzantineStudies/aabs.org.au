An educational tour is taking place between June 4-20 2015 on the theme
of theÂ **Journey of St Paul and Classical Greece**.

The tour
will follow the sites that the Apostle Paul travelled to in Greece, with
professional guides to explain all the sites in English.

The
itinerary also includes an audience with the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch
Bartholomew in Constantinople, plus Delphi, Olympia, Rhodes and
Patmos.

Already travellers are booking from Sydney,
Melbourne, Perth and Cairns. Anyone from anywhere in Australia is able
to join.

The Melbourne-based travel agent Steven Green is
available to speak to a group of any interested persons who may wish to
have an information evening about the itinerary.

wish to stay on in Europe beyond the return date are free to do
so.
