The Society for Late Antiquity will again sponsor two sessions at the
International Medieval Studies Congress, **May 14-17, 2015** at Western
Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Mich. As in the past, topics are open.
One-page abstracts for 15-minute papers are invited relating to the
history, literature, religion, art, archaeology, culture, and society of
Late Antiquity (that is, the European, North African, and Western Asian
world ca. 250-750). Attention should be given to how the paper relates
to Late Antiquity as a discrete period with its own individual
characteristics. Titles and abstracts may be forwarded to Ralph Mathisen
at <ralphwm@illinois.edu> and <ruricius@msn.com>. Deadline for receipt
of abstracts is **September 15 2014**. Abstracts must be accompanied by
an e-copy of the participant information form available at
<http://wmich.edu/medieval/congress/submissions/index.html#PIF> or
<http://wmich.edu/medieval/files/pif-2015.pdf>. Please note that with
the exception of a few awards (information available from conference
organizers at <http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/congress>) there is no
travel funding available for participants, and that the submission of an
abstract carries with it a commitment to attend the conference should
the abstract be accepted.
