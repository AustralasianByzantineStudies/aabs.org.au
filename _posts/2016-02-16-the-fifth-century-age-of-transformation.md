Shifting Frontiers in Late Antiquity Twelfth Biennial Conference, Yale
University, **23-26 March 2017**

The Society for Late
Antiquity announces that the Twelfth Biennial Conference on Shifting
Frontiers in Late Antiquity will be held at Yale University on the topic
of "The Fifth Century: Age of Transformation." The conference will be
cosponsored by the University of Groningen.

In chronological
terms there can be little doubt that the fifth century is the pivot
point of Late Antiquity. It is arguable that it also represents the
major watershed between a monolithic world still dominated by the Roman
Empire in the third and fourth centuries and the more tessellated worlds
of the sixth and seventh. Whereas the fourth century is still very much
an age of continuity with the earlier empire, the fifth can rightfully
be viewed as the moment when Mediterranean Eurasia and North Africa
witnessed profound political, social, religious, economic and cultural
transformations. Shifting Frontiers XII seeks to investigate the nature
and impact of these changes. We are particularly interested in six areas
of research which reflect this transformational trend:
1) Shifts in
the archaeological and material record: archaeology of the frontier; art
and power; spoliation, collectionism, preservation;
2) State
formation, re-formation, transformation: emperors, kings, rulers; law
codes; new loci of political power -- desert and steppe;
3)
Transformations in religious authority: east and west -- tension and
cooperation; traditional religion; notions of the divine; popular
practice;
4) Changes in climate, environment, geography:
demography, disaster, microclimates / macroclimates; resource
allocation;
5) Literary transformations: epitomes, canons,
excerpts; commentary; vernacular literature (Syriac, Coptic, Armenian,
Georgian); translation/transcription;
6) Identity transformation:
ethnicity and identity; gender and sexuality; uses of alterity -- etic
and emic.

As in the past, we intend for the conference to
provide an interdisciplinary forum for historians, archaeologists and
specialists in religious studies, near-eastern or Asian studies and
scholars of Greek, Latin, Syriac, Coptic, Georgian, Armenian, Persian
and Ge'ez literature. The conference should open a forum for the
exploration of intersections between the world cultures of Europe, Asia
and Africa and the ways in which these peoples and places collided and
were recombined to launch the global Middle Age.

Proposals
should be clearly related to the theme of the conference and one of the
above areas of research, and should state clearly both the problem being
discussed and the nature of the new discoveries, insights, or
conclusions that will be presented. Abstracts of not more than 500 words
for 20-minute presentations may be submitted via e-mail to Professors
Noel Lenski and Jan Willem Drijvers, at
<shiftingfrontiers.12@gmail.com>. Deadline for submission of abstracts
is **October 15 2016**.
