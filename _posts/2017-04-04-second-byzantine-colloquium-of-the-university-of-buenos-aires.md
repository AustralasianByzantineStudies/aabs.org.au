Rivers
of ink have flown since A. Kazhdan's seminal contribution, "Byzantine
Hagiography and Sex in the Fifth to Twelfth Century" (1990), including
V. Burrus' *The Sex Lives of Saints* (2004). Nevertheless, to the best
of our knowledge no study to date covers in a comprehensive way divine
and human love, the codification of the relation between sexes, the
interaction between an avowed morality and the real practice of
sexuality. This colloquium aims to put together a number of works
tackling these and similar issues.

A historical,
anthropological or sociological perspective still has a fair job to do
in this area. The UBA research team, with its focus on narratology, will
pay special attention to love as a dynamic principle in Byzantine
storytelling, either hagiographical, historical, or of other kind.
Indeed, the centrality of love, which can take myriad forms (as a
*topos*, as a target towards which a given plot aims, as a powerful tool
towards meaningful characterization, as a social expectation horizon,
etc.) should be evaluated in the framework of the evolution of narrative
forms. We believe that a dynamic analysis of erotic motifs can be so
productive for diachronic narrativity as the spatiality, temporality, or
the studies of narrators and narratees.

At the same time, any
other point of view is welcome: from a presentation on the *Song of
Songs*, to a study of Byzantine marriage; from the love poetry in the
*Anthology* to the apparent desacralization of erotism studied by H.-G.
Beck in his *Byzantinisches Erotikon*; from the ever-lasting reading of
the Greek novels to the erotic connotations -- or not -- of virginity
and mystical experience. More metaphorical subjects such as the "love of
learning" are also welcome.

Please send your abstract no
later than **May 31 2017** to
