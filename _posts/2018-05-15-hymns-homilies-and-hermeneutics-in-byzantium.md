On Saturday **18 August 2018**, the Australasian Association for
Byzantine Studies will hold a symposium at Macquarie University entitled
"Hymns, Homilies and Hermeneutics in Byzantium."

The
symposium coincides with the first ever visit to Australia by Dr
Damaskinos Olkinuora, a Finnish scholar and Byzantinist. Dr Olkinuora is
a senior lecturer at the University of Eastern Finland and has published
widely on aspects of Byzantine liturgy, hymnology and
theology.

The symposium will explore the interactions between
hymnody, homiletics and hermeneutics in Byzantium. It will probe how
hymns and homilies functioned as a form of biblical exegesis in the
liturgical life of the Byzantines but also more broadly in a
performative sense and as a source of identity.
