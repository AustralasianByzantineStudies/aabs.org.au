The seventh St Andrew's Patristic Symposium focuses on the
personality, contributions and legacy of Saint John
Chrysostom.

Given the traditional interdisciplinary nature of
our symposia, the conveners welcome proposals on the main theme and
related or unrelated topics pertaining to patristic tradition. All
approaches, from theological to philological, from hermeneutical to
ethical, from pastoral to exegetical, from historical to spiritual etc.,
are welcome. Abstracts of up to 200 words should be sent to Doru
Costache at
[dcostache@sagotc.edu.au](mailto:dcostache@sagotc.edu.au),
by the **end of May 2016.** The abstracts should be accompanied by brief
biographical notes, mainly detailing the qualifications and affiliations
of the contributors.

Two bursaries of $500 (each) will be
available for Australian postgraduate students not based in NSW,
generously offered by Australian Research Theology Foundation Inc. To
win a bursary, postgraduate students should send their papers in
full-length to Doru Costache at
[dcostache@sagotc.edu.au](mailto:dcostache@sagotc.edu.au)
by the end of May 2016. The papers should not exceed 3,000 words,
including footnotes. The winners of the two bursaries will be announced
by the end of June 2016.
