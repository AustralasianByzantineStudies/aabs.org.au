   2017 Meeting of ReLACS (Regional Late Antiquity Consortium Southeast)
date: 2017-06-17

**October 19-20 2017**, Vanderbilt University

ReLACS, now in
its fifth year, is a regional workshop of scholars of Late Antiquity
held on a rotating basis at Vanderbilt University, the University of
Tennessee, and the University of Kentucky.

The 2017 meeting
will be hosted by the Program in Classical and Mediterranean Studies and
the Divinity School at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. Participation
is open to all scholars interested in Late Antiquity broadly defined.
Participation by graduate students is particularly
encouraged.

The workshop kicks off with a public lecture on
the evening of Thursday, October 19th given by Stephen J. Davis,
Professor of Religious Studies and Near Eastern Languages and
Civilizations at Yale University, on "The Archaeology of Early Christian
Monasticism: Evidentiary Problems and Criteria." This lecture presents a
reassessment of what we know (and how we know what we know) about the
archaeological evidence for Christian monasticism in the first
millennium CE. Assessing the current state of the field, Prof. Davis
will first address problems we face in both the identification and the
dating of "monastic" sites and then discuss criteria by which we can
engage more critically with the material evidence available to
us.

On Friday, October 20th, the workshop will host several
sessions. Phillip I. Lieberman, Associate Professor of Jewish Studies
and Law at Vanderbilt University, will lead a pro-seminar on
"Introduction to the Cairo Geniza" designed to introduce non-specialists
to resources for using the Geniza in teaching and research. The Cairo
Geniza comprises the largest collection of documentary materials from
the premodern Islamic world and is a critical resource for the social,
economic, legal, and political history of the reception of antiquity
into the medieval Mediterranean.

In addition we invite
proposals from regional participants for work-in-progress papers on any
topic broadly related to Late Antiquity or the early middle ages in any
geographic region. Papers will be given 30-minute sessions and may be
read aloud or pre-circulated to allow more time for
discussion.

Please send a short description of the paper
(approximately 200 words) including mention of its context (conference
paper, part of a book manuscript, etc.) to David Michelson
(<david.a.michelson@vanderbilt.edu>). Paper proposals will be considered
by a steering committee (faculty from UT, VU, and UK) and selections
will be made on the basis of maximizing regional participation from a
diverse group of presenters. Proposals are due by **August 1 2017**.
