   12th International Congress of Cretan Studies
date: 2015-07-06
---

According to the decision taken during the closing session of the 11th
International Congress of Cretan Studies (27/10/2011), the organization
of the 12th International Congress of Cretan Studies was entrusted to
the Society of Cretan Historical Studies which has appointed its
Organizing Committee. The President and the Members of the Committee
hereby address the call for the expression of interest to all wishing to
participate in the 12th International Congress of Cretan
Studies.

The Congress will be held in the city of Heraklion
from the 22nd to the 26th of September 2016, and its proceedings will be
divided into three main sections which correspond to the three long
periods of Cretan history:
a) the Prehistoric and Ancient Greek
period,
b) the Byzantine and Medieval period, and
c) the
Modern period (up to the late 20th century).

The selected
thematic axis for all three sections of the 12th International Congress
of Cretan Studies shall be mobility. Those interested in participating
in the Congress are thus invited to address the theme in reference to
Crete and insularity in historical perspective. More specifically, the
thematic of mobility addresses:
• The migration of people to, from
and within Crete. Mobility therefore refers to geographic and spatial
-peaceful or violent- human group mobility and the new realities it
engendered.
• The flow of goods, services and practices in relation
to paths, routes, journeys and the exchange of both tangible and
intangible forms of culture.
• Social mobility and social and
ideological transformations with reference to social change,
stratification, and the configuration of the urban and rural areas.
Changes in the social, institutional (civic, political and
administrative), cultural and natural environment are also included,
with the correlation and integration of these aspects into broader
geopolitical and cultural contexts being considered
preferable.

All wishing to participate in the Congress are
invited to submit an abstract of 300-500 words of their proposal at the
electronic platform www.12-ICCS.gr, from the 15th of July to the 30th of
November 2015.

Proposals may include either panels or paper
presentations (oral or poster). For joint proposals for Workshops,
please submit an overall summary of 200-400 words and abstracts of
300-500 words for each separate announcement.

The thematic
axis of "mobility" is not considered obligatory in the cases of poster
presentation proposals.

The abstracts submitted should list
the main issues addressed, the general research framework, marking out
the aspects of originality of the proposed contribution.
Only one
proposal per applicant should be submitted (either individually or
jointly).
The languages of the Congress will be Greek, English,
French, German and Italian.
The acceptance or rejection of
submitted proposals will be communicated preserving the anonymity of the
scientific committee's reviews, by the 15th of March 2016.
Each
presentation should not exceed fifteen (15') minutes plus another five
(5') minutes for discussion.

The Congress will be organized
in three plenary sessions with invited speakers to be announced
shortly.

The participation fee for contributors is thirty
(30) Euros. Free participation will be granted to postgraduate and PhD
students, and unemployed scholars.

The Proceedings of the
12th International Congress of Cretan Studies will certainly be
published and at least in the form of an e-book shortly after the
completion of the Congress.
