---

As part of its ongoing commitment to Byzantine studies, the Mary Jaharis
Center for Byzantine Art and Culture seeks proposals for a Mary Jaharis
Center sponsored session at the 49th Annual Byzantine Studies Conference
to be held at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada, October
**26--29, 2023**. We invite session proposals on any topic relevant to
Byzantine studies.

The conference will be in-person
only.

Session proposals must be submitted through the Mary
Jaharis Center website. The deadline for submission is **April 3,
2023.**

If the proposed session is accepted, the Mary Jaharis
Center will reimburse a maximum of 5 session participants (presenters
and chair) up to $800 maximum for scholars based in North America and
up to $1400 maximum for those coming from outside North America.
Funding is through reimbursement only; advance funding cannot be
provided. Eligible expenses include conference registration,
transportation, and food and lodging. Receipts are required for
reimbursement. Participants must participate in the conference in-person
to receive funding. The Mary Jaharis Center regrets that it cannot
reimburse participants who have last-minute cancellations and are unable
to attend the conference.
