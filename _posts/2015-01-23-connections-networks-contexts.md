Run by the Late Antique and Medieval
Postgraduate Society from the University of Edinburgh

The
Late Antique and Postgraduate Society (LAMPS) at the University of
Edinburgh is holding a one-day conference on the theme of *Connections,
Networks, and Contexts* within the time period of *Late Antique to
Medieval*. While interdisciplinary approaches to academic research may
have been less common just a few years ago, there has recently been an
increased interest in working across disciplinary boundaries. For the
last five years, the Late Antique and Medieval Postgraduate Society from
the University of Edinburgh has worked under a similar ethos, organising
seminars for postgraduate students to present their work and exchange
ideas across academic disciplines.

We welcome proposals for
20 minute papers and A3 posters from any relevant department, including
Archaeology, History, Classics, History of Art, Literature, Language
Studies, and Islamic Studies among others. Early career scholars and
postgraduate students are invited to submit abstracts of up to 300 words
for papers, and 200 words for posters, to
[lampsedinburgh@gmail.com](mailto:lampsedinburgh@gmail.com).
To be considered, proposals must be received by **2 March 2015**.
Confirmations of acceptance will be sent at least one month in advance.
This conference is being put on with the support of the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland.
