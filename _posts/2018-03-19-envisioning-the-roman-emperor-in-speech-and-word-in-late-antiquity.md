On Wednesday **July 25 2018** a colloquium will be held at **Macquarie
University** on the topic of "Envisioning the Roman Emperor in Speech
and Word in Late Antiquity".

This colloquium is organised by
**Dr Meaghan McEvoy** as part of the Faculty of Arts Visiting Fellowship
Grant for the visit to MQ of **Assoc. Prof. Jan Willem Drijvers**
(University of Groningen, the Netherlands) and is supported by the MQ
Ancient Cultures Research Centre and the Australasian Society for
Classical Studies.

Assoc. Prof. Drijvers is a distinguished
scholar of late Roman studies, whose many publications range from
seminal works on the empress Helena, mother of the first Christian
emperor Constantine, to a series of scholarly commentaries on the key
late Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus, and studies of the Syriac
Julian Romance.  His current research projects include a monograph on
the emperor Jovian and new commentaries on the *Panegyrici Latini*. 
This is his first visit to Australia and offers a crucial opportunity

colloquium.
