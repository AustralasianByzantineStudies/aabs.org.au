Tvärminne, Finland, **17--18 October 2014**

The XXIII Finnish
Symposium on Late Antiquity will be organized on 17--18 October 2014.
The aim of the symposium is to bring together scholars and postgraduate
students with an interest in Late Antiquity from a variety of
universities and disciplines. Our main aim is to stimulate
interdisciplinary dialogue between philology, archaeology, history,
theology, religious studies, art history and other disciplines that deal
with Late Antiquity.

The theme of the symposium in 2014 is
"Conflict in Late Antiquity". It will be approached from a wide
perspective, including different types and levels of conflict and
attempts at solving them. Conflict can be discussed from the from the
point of view of politics and competition for power, ethnic conflicts,
conflicts between different areas and peoples of the empire, cultural
and religious conflicts between and within traditions, doctrinal
conflict, interpretation and portrayal of conflict in literature and
art, personal conflicts, and conflicts versus everyday life. We welcome
papers that discuss scholarly approaches to late antiquity, why the
sources and scholarship focus so emphatically on conflict, and what
other perspectives can be applied instead.

There is space for
a maximum of nine more papers. If you wish to deliver a paper, please
send a short abstract (maximum length 300 words) by **1 June 2014** to
Dr. Ville Vuolan to <ville.vuolanto@uta.fi>. We encourage not only
senior, but also junior scholars and postgraduate students to
participate.

Applicants will be informed by 19 June 2014
whether they have been accepted. We have reserved 30 minutes for each
presentation including discussion, wherefore we recommend limiting the
papers to 20 minutes.

The symposium will be organized in the
premises of a zoological research station operated by the University of
Helsinki at a beautiful location at Tvärminne on the southern coast of
Finland (<http://luoto.tvarminne.helsinki.fi/english>). It is organized
by an interdisciplinary organizing committee under the auspices of the
center of excellence "Reason and Religious Recognition" in the Faculty
of Theology, University of Helsinki, together with Department of World
Cultures, University of Helsinki.

The seminar is free. We
will offer transportation from Helsinki to Tvärminne and the return
journey, as well as accommodation (one night) and meals in Tvärminne.
However, we are not able to cover any travel costs to or accommodation
in Helsinki. Registration for the conference will start 1 September and
