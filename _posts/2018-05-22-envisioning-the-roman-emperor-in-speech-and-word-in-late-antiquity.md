This colloquium is organised by **Dr Meaghan McEvoy** as
part of the Faculty of Arts Visiting Fellowship Grant for the visit to
MQ of **Assoc. Prof. Jan Willem Drijvers** (University of Groningen, the
Netherlands) and is supported by the MQ Ancient Cultures Research Centre
and the Australasian Society for Classical Studies.

Assoc.
Prof. Drijvers is a distinguished scholar of late Roman studies, whose
many publications range from seminal works on the empress Helena, mother
of the first Christian emperor Constantine, to a series of scholarly
commentaries on the key late Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus, and
studies of the Syriac Julian Romance.  His current research projects
include a monograph on the emperor Jovian and new commentaries on the
*Panegyrici Latini*.  This is his first visit to Australia and offers a
crucial opportunity for students of Roman and late antique studies in
particular to benefit from his expertise in this area.
