Due
to its remarkably long duration, territorial expanse, geographical
situation and complex cultural traditions, Byzantium acted as a temporal
and spatial bridge connecting different periods, geographical areas, and
cultures.  Byzantium acted as a transition between ancient, medieval and
early modern worlds around the Mediterranean basin, Eurasia and the Near
East through reception, appropriation, and innovation. It connected
different geographical and cultural spaces through political, economic,
material, and cultural networks in many of which it constituted an
important node.  Centering on the key theme of "Byzantium -- Bridge
between Worlds," the 24th International Congress of Byzantine Studies
aims to explore this connecting and mediatory role of Byzantium.  It
also hopes to initiate proposals on bridging interdisciplinary gaps
within Byzantine studies and strengthening dialogue with other relevant
fields.
