Byzantium
was one of the longest-lasting empires in history. Throughout the
millennium of its existence, the empire showed its capability to change
and develop under very different historical circumstances. This
remarkable resilience would have been impossible to achieve without the
formation of a lasting imperial culture and a strong imperial
ideological infrastructure. Imperial culture and ideology required,
among other things, to sort out who was ʻinsiderʼ and who was ʻoutsiderʼ
and develop ways to define and describe ones neighbours and interact
with them.

There is an indefinite number of possibilities for
the exploration of relationships between Byzantium and its neighbours.
The essays in this collection focus on several interconnected clusters
of topics and shared research interests, such as the place of neighbours
in the context of the empire and imperial ideology, the transfer of
knowledge with neighbours, the Byzantine perception of their neighbours
and the political relationship and/or the conflict with
neighbours.
