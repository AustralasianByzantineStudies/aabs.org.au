For the past five decades, Byzantinists have explored gender and
sexuality. More recent work has turned to gendered emotions and
religious devotion. While much of this research has its origin in
women's history, there has been an increasing interest in men, including
monks and eunuchs, and in the articulations and performances of
masculinity.

This conversation brings together scholars
across the globe who have actively promoted this research to reflect on
their work and its evolving academic and nonacademic
contexts.

Austrian Academy of Sciences) and Derek Krueger (University of North
Carolina at Greensboro)
