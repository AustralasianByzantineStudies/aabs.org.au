New Trajectories in Australian Research on Late Antiquity and Early
Christian Studies

21--23 July 2021

Call for
Proposals

The Program in Biblical and Early Christian Studies
in ACU's Institute for Religion and Critical Inquiry is hosting a
symposium in Melbourne on 21--23 July 2021 to showcase the cutting-edge
research currently being done in Australia in the fields of late antique
studies and early Christian studies. The event will be built around
plenary addresses from investigators on projects in these fields funded
by the Australian Research Council over the past five years (see below).
As is evident from this collection of projects, Australian research in
these areas spans an impressively diverse range of scholarly approaches
including social history, political history, lived ancient religion,
religious pluralism and conflict, literary studies, philosophical
studies, and ancient material culture. The aim of the event is to
provide a forum for disseminating the knowledge generated by these
projects, while also exploring the insights sparked by
inter-disciplinary dialogue across them, with an eye towards potential
cross-institutional collaboration on future projects.

With
that goal in view, we seek proposals for short communications from
scholars at all career stages. We invite two types of short
presentations: a traditional conference paper on a focused topic or a
discussion of an idea for a grant project in some stage of development
that might invite interest or collaboration from other participants. Our
hope is that this setting provides a venue for workshopping ideas and
for early career researchers to receive mentoring in the grant
process.

The current plan is to hold the event in-person at
ACU's Melbourne campus. Due to the closure of international borders,
this means that it will be open only to Australian and New Zealand
participants. If an in-person event proves impossible due to state
border closures, it will be shifted to an online format. Financial
support is available for a limited number of early career researchers to
help cover the cost of airfare and accommodation. If you would like to
be considered for a bursary, please note this when you submit your
proposal. Proposals of 200-250 words should be sent to
<becs.events@acu.edu.au> by 12 April 2021.
