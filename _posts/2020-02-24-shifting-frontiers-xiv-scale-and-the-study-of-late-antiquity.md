title: Shifting Frontiers XIV: Scale and the Study of Late Antiquity
date: 2020-02-24

Ohio State University in Columbus Ohio, **24-27 **March
2021****.

For the Fourteenth Meeting of the Society for Late
Antiquity, we invite papers that investigate scale, which can be defined
as a graduated range of values or measurements, whether, for example, of
time, space, social organization, cosmology, or agency. Participants are
encouraged to explore scale either as a methodological framework used by
modern historians to interpret the past and/or as a type of late Roman
analytic category, developed and employed by late ancient persons for
their own heuristic purposes.

Questions papers might ask
include:

To what extent does the world of Late Antiquity look
different if we approach its events, institutions, and processes
(whether political, economic, social, or religious) from a micro scale
rather than a macro scale, and vice versa? How can we better understand
the late Roman Empire through the examination of macro- and micro-scalar
environmental phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions and mutating plague
DNA, which were only partially (if at all) perceptible to the late
Romans themselves? Alternatively, what graduated categories of
measurement and values did late ancient thinkers deploy in their
philosophical, scientific (including astrological), and religious works
to make sense of metaphysical, ethical, or even physical quandaries? And
what did scale mean to individuals on an everyday level, for
agriculturalists or merchants whose livelihoods were embedded within
multi-scalar economic, environmental, legal, social, and religious
networks? Other papers might consider the fractal replication of
structures and relationships across the Empire, for example in conciliar
operations (Senate, local curia, church councils), patterns of deference
across the social scale, or in the provincial extensions of imperial
authority. Comparativists are encouraged to consider how problems of
scale inflect transhistorical arguments that encompass both late
antiquity and other periods of history.
