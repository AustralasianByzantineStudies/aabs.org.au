The AABS invites applications for funding for workshops based upon the
following criteria:


1.  Funding of up to $500 for a workshop, conference or seminar on a
    theme relating to Byzantine Studies.  A program should be included
    in the application.
2.  The amount should be for an event to be held within 12 months of the
    award of the funds.
3.  A committee comprised of the President, Treasurer and Secretary to
    decide within 3 weeks of submission.  Where an absolute majority of
    such a committee is based in one institution, State or Territory,
    the committee will be expanded by the minimum number of additional
    members needed to ensure that no one institution, State or Territory
    holds an absolute majority on the Committee.  Any such additional
    committee members will be appointed from the AABS committee on the
    nomination of the President.
4.  Funds may be spent on airfares, accommodation for speakers, venue
    costs or catering; a detailed budget should be presented in the
    application.
5.  Applications should be addressed to the secretary:
    <secretary@aabs.org.au>.
6.   Submissions will be accepted on 30 April and a second round offered
    on 1 October (funds permitting).
7.  Maximum of one grant per year for any given institution, State or
    Territory.
8.  Applicants for funding must be paid-up members of AABS.
