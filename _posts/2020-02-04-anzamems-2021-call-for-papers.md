The Australian and New Zealand Association for Medieval and
Early Modern Studies conference committee seeks proposals for its 2021
conference on the theme 'Reception and Emotion', to be held in Perth,
Australia at The University of Western Australia from **8--12 February
2021**.

The committee welcomes all approaches to topics
related to 'reception and emotion' broadly conceived (and conceived
either together or separately: i.e., on reception and emotion, or on
either reception or emotion), including but not limited to:
trans-cultural, trans-temporal, trans-disciplinary, translation, global
studies, creative misreadings, theatrical and literary revivals,
forgeries, homages, cultural counter-strikes, regimes of periodisation,
etc. We welcome proposals considering the usefulness or otherwise of
reception history as a methodology: is 'transformation' more helpful
than 'reception', for example, for appreciating the active role of the
audience of a text, play, or idea?

Work on emotions can be
similarly broad, covering, e.g., what's evidenced from the 'receivers'
and from the 'received' (thinking of work, for example, on how
Indigenous people have received missionaries and their doctrines; how
medievalists have reacted and acted in relation to the worrying
associations of their discipline; even how humanities scholars feel
about their reception in contemporary political circles; Jan Plamper's
suggestion that historians should keep 'field diaries' about their
personal response to work in the archives; are there 'objective'
studies?). What's been the value and downside of the 'emotional turn' in
humanities studies? How do we as scholars of the past deal with
presentist notions of 'relevance', and need we consider past scholarship
as 'outdated? How can we marry approaches from humanities and life
sciences in 'emotions history'?

The conference committee
invites proposals for 20-minute papers, 90-minute themed panels (of no
more than 4 speakers) or workshops. Paper topics may include, but are
not limited to:


-   The reception of ideas about emotion in medieval/early modern texts;
-   Reception and transformation of ideologies across time and space;
-   The emotions of an audience in the reception of a play or sermon;
-   The emotional impact of a text on a reader;
-   Rituals and practices of receiving guests and dignitaries (and their
    emotional effects?);
-   The reception of the past: medievalism and early-modernism;
-   The reception of bodies / emotions and bodies / embodiment;
-   Reception / emotion and sexuality;
-   Reception / emotion and race;
-   Reception / emotion and gender;
-   Reception / emotion and music / art.
