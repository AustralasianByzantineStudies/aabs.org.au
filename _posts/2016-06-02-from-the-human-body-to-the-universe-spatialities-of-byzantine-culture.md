   From the Human Body to the Universe: Spatialities of Byzantine Culture
date: 2016-06-02

Uppsala University, **18-21 May 2017**

[Call for
papers](http://www.grekiska.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CFP_Space.docx)

The
injunction to historicize space has not always been on the agenda of
researchers in Byzantine Studies. Traditionally,  philologists,
archaeologists, historians and art-historians have been tempted to take
space for granted. And yet, within the recent **Spatial Turn** in the
humanities and the social sciences,  research on spatial paradigms and
practices has been expanding, gaining great attention across disciplines
and vastly different periods. In this context, space has been attributed
a complex involvement in historical developments, as a comprehensive
concept constituted by the integration of absolute and relative,
relational and materially-sensed, physical and social, conceptualized
and lived space. An engagement of Byzantinists with these ways of
thought and action opens up an entire new set of possibilities for
understanding the Byzantine world.

Many cultural aspects
speak for the crucial importance of spatialities for the Byzantines.
Their bodies and minds are performed as their most personal spaces of
social identity and control. These bodies interact with their natural
environments in their struggle to survive and create, thus producing
their spatial experiences. In that way they construct their own
culturally appropriated spaces, producing Byzantine landscapes. These
landscapes are dominated by power relations, which divide them into
territories, and performed by cultural practices. Passing from the body
to the mind, imaginary spaces host moments of a universe of heaven and
human passions. How are all these Byzantine spaces relevant to us,
today, and in what ways can we understand them? These are the main
issues addressed by this conference.

We are welcoming
abstracts which interrogate the various understandings of space in
Byzantine culture, those which present new methodological approaches to
the topic, and case studies which are placed within a wider theoretical
context from all fields of Byzantine Studies (history, archaeology,
philology, art history, museum studies etc).

The papers
should refer to one of the following broad thematic
panels:

1. The (most) Private Space: *the body as
topos*
2. Natural Spaces: *Byzantine environments*
3.
Experienced Spaces: *human bodies within the natural
environment*
4. Anthropogenic Spaces: *Byzantine
landscapes*
5. Empowered Spaces: *Byzantine territories*
6.
Performed Spaces: *the spatiality of cultural practices*
7.
Imaginary Spaces: *Byzantine story worlds*
8. Representations of
Byzantine Spaces, *now and then*

Possible topics may touch
upon, but are not limited to, the following areas of research:


-   Byzantinists and Space: methodological and theoretical approaches in
    history, archaeology, art histroy and philology
-   Representations of space
-   Going Global: linking local, regional, national, transnational
    Byzantine histories
-   Symbolic geography and cultural spaces: for example 'Byzantium,
    'Asia Minor'  or the 'Balkans', the 'Levant', the'West' and the
    'Orient', etc.
-   The spatial constitution of politics: the empires and neighbouring
    states (territoriality, kinship)
-   Economic history: economic systems, 'core' and 'periphery'
-   Spatial dimensions of everyday life: approaching gender, ethnicity,
    class, religion
-   Urban spaces (morphology, planning; spaces of production,
    consumption and exchange, urban/rural divides)
-   Geographies of knowledge: production and transfers
-   Space and Memory.


The working languages of the conference will be English and
French. If you are interested to attend by oral or poster presentation,
please send an abstract of no more than 400 words, the thematic panel to
which you would like to contribute and a brief CV to
<myrto.veikou@lingfil.uu.se> by **September 30, 2016**.  Due to the wide
scope of this event, we would like to ask participants to prepare oral
presentations of no more than 15 minutes, so as to allow ample time for
discussion.
