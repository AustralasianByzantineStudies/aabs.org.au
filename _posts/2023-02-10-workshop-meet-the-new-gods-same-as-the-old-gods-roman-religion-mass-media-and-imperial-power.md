Workshop: "Meet the New Gods, Same as
the Old Gods?: Roman Religion, Mass Media and Imperial
Power"

29 April 2023

University of Newcastle
(NSW)

The death of Queen Elizabeth II, head of the Church of
England and "defender of the faith", reminds all Australians of the
links among religion, imperial politics and mass media expressed in
coins, processions, and public statues. Scholars have long recognized
the continuities of time and space across the Roman empire of all these
mechanisms of imperial power and communication, from the formation of
Rome's overseas empire in the 3rd century BCE into Late Antiquity.
However, the conversion of emperors and their mass media to Christianity
has been seen as a watershed break with centuries of tradition, with the
gods, rituals and hence mass media of Roman and Hellenic religion wholly
replaced or displaced within the course of the 4th and 5th centuries.
This workshop aims to recover and restore nuance to the continuities
across the centuries of Roman imperial power and its religious
expression in the ancient mass media.

Titles and short
abstracts (250 words max) of research papers of 10 to 20 minutes are
invited by email toÂ <ryan.strickler@newcastle.edu.au>. Deadline for
Submissions is 31 March 2023.

The organizers encourage
submissions from Australia- and New Zealand-based scholars at all stages

role of personifications in Roman imperial media; the changing role of
portrait statues of emperors in the 4th century; the use of incense in
imperial and Christian ritual; the titles of the emperors, and how those

'Popular responses
to the assassination of Julius Caesar (44-42 BCE): Media, religion,
emotion'

*Abstract*: In the months following Caesar's
assassination on 15 March 44 BCE, it seems that the tyrannicides Brutus
and Cassius, and their followers, were surprised by the depth of popular
feeling in favour of Caesar. They were surprised by the people's use of
violence, but more fundamentally by their acceptance of Caesar as father
and god. The aim of this paper, in light of recent influence from media
studies, is to investigate with fresh eyes some of the means by which
the Roman people experienced these ideas, some of the ways they acted on
them, and some of the reasons why they accepted them as strongly as they
did. Elements of the people seem to have been invested in Caesar's
divine status far more than they were ever invested in any political
offices or legal powers he held during his career. The attraction of the
charismatic or ideological or divine aspects of his power continues to
demand our attention.
