17th Unisa Classics Colloquium, **26-28 October
2016**

Proposals are hereby solicited for papers on the
conference theme which intends to explore the fascination of Greco-Roman
antiquity with personal detail, and how this came to be packaged in
written forms. The organisers are interested not only in biography as a
separate genre, but also in other and smaller formats which divulge
information on individual lives. We will be looking to include a broad
spectrum of interests in the conference programme: from epic to
historiography, scholia to epigrams, inscriptions to fictional letters,
oratory to gospels.

Please submit titles and abstracts of
approximately 300 words to Philip Bosman at
[bosmapr@unisa.ac.za](mailto:bosmapr@unisa.ac.za), as
soon as possible. All proposals are carefully considered, but bear in
mind that slots are limited.

Deadline for proposals: **15
June 2016**.

Convening in 2016 for the 17th time, the Unisa
Classics Colloquium combines stimulating scholarship with a pleasant and
intimate atmosphere. Over two and a half days, approximately 20
scholarly contributions from around the world are to be presented. The
40 minute slots provide ample time for discussion and valuable feedback.
Parallel sessions are avoided in order to promote unity of focus in the
conference, and delegates get to know each other properly. Information
on previous conferences may be found at

OR Tambo Airport and in Pretoria on the morning of the 25th and only

compiled from the proposals received and will be published on the
Departmental website after the final date for
submissions.
